abstract = {{The implementation of the European Water Framework Directive has provoked enthusiastic debate between scientists and stakeholders, as they try to define the ecological quality status (EcoQS) of all water bodies, including estuaries (i.e., transitional waters). The issue is complex because estuarine environments are variable, due to fresh and marine water input and anthropogenic impacts. Benthic species and communities have adapted to tolerate temporal physico-chemical changes (e.g., salinity, substrata, depth, fine particles and a Maximum Turbidity Zone that is rich in organic matter). However, anthropogenization affects not only the water quality, but also estuarine surface size and navigation channel management. Though numerous bio-indicators and indices are used to define estuarine system EcoQS, very few of them were developed specifically for such variable anthropogenized systems comprising a variety of conditions. The critical question is: ‘Is it possible to define an EcoQS for such specific modified and naturally stressed ecosystems?’ Indicators must be chosen pragmatically so that they will be environmentally sustainable, economically viable, technologically feasible, socially desirable/tolerable, legally permissible and politically expedient. This contribution proposes an adaptation of the BOPA index, the Benthic Opportunistic Annelida Amphipod index (BO2A), for use in the freshwater zones of transitional waters (i.e., up to the upper limit of tidal range). Several possibilities are discussed in light of the diverse disturbances and the heterogeneity of such stressed zones.}},

After comparing this new index to AMBI and BENTIX, two other indices that have been proposed in the literature, we tested it in two situations involving soft-bottom communities in the English Channel (Bay of Morlaix and Bay of Seine). Our results show that the BOPA index is simple to use. Amphipods and opportunistic polychaetes (21 species, nine genus and two families from the AZTI list for a total of 3459 taxa) are easy to identify, providing that both the number of these organisms in a sample and the total number of individuals collected (independent of the sampling surface) is known.

Suites of fish community metrics, including measures of species composition, diversity and abundance, trophic structure and life history function, were selected via a novel weight of evidence approach on the basis of their sensitivity to detect inter-annual change in estuarine condition. For each selected metric, seasonally-adjusted reference conditions were established for each spatial management zone of the Swan Estuary using 30 years of standardised historical fish assemblage data. This extensive data set provided a sound basis for determining the ‘best available’ standard of biotic integrity recorded over that time period and thus a reliable benchmark against which the current and future health of the estuary may be assessed and compared. The nearshore and offshore indices were robust to the effects of natural, intra-seasonal variability in environmental conditions, and so provide reliable tools for quantifying and classifying the ecological health of the Swan Estuary and its constituent management zones. The response of the nearshore index to an algal bloom confirmed that it is sufficiently sensitive to quantify ecological health responses to local-scale environmental perturbations and to track the subsequent recovery of the system following their removal. The indices provide managers with a reliable, quantitative method for assessing and communicating the health of the Swan Estuary and, similarly, of other estuaries across south-western Australia.}},

A key challenge for estuary managers and scientists is how to effectively quantify and monitor these changes in ecological condition in a timely and cost-effective manner. We developed a Rapid Assessment Protocol (RAP) for characterizing sediment condition based on the qualitative characteristics of sediment colour, odour and texture. We evaluated its utility for assessing sediment condition, and particularly the degree and effects of sediment enrichment (as quantified by complementary measurements of total C, organic C and total N) across 97 sites throughout a eutrophic microtidal estuary. RAP results were strongly and significantly correlated with the degree of sediment enrichment, with RAP scores correctly identifying the assigned enrichment class (low, medium, high) of 83.5\% of sites. More enriched sediments exhibited poorer condition, manifested as significantly lower RAP scores for sediment colour, texture and odour, particularly (but not only) where enrichment coincided with elevated mud content. The RAP was particularly successful (<12\% misclassification) at identifying sites with low levels of enrichment, indicating its promise as a first-pass survey approach for identifying potential reference or control sites to support impact assessments. RAP approaches based on qualitative sediment characteristics can provide a useful proxy for the degree and impacts of inorganic and organic enrichment, with potentially broad applicability for supporting timely, cost-effective assessment and monitoring of sediment condition in estuaries worldwide.}},

Macrofaunal communities were surveyed using an Ekman grab and a modified epibenthic sled (dredge) at each sampling site: data for 24 environmental variables were also collected. Twenty-eight estuaries were sampled on a single occasion during late summer at three stratified locations within each estuary (upper, mid and lower). Macrofaunal community composition was best explained by a common environmental gradient summarising variation in both salinity and longitude. Hence, although the distribution of macrofaunal taxa can be clearly linked to changes in salinity, the geographical position of the sites along an east–west axis, rather than a generalised down-stream gradient, appears to best explain the data. This association was primarily linked to broad-scale changes in estuarine morphology across the geographical range of this survey. A sediment-based environmental gradient among grab samples, but not dredge samples, reflected the largely infaunal nature of the grab samples. In general, the present survey did not support the classification of estuarine assemblages on the basis of a range of physical parameters but, instead, emphasised the continuity of estuarine benthic macrofaunal community structure on a broad spatial scale.}},

These banks fail to generate conditions suitable to sediment nutrient release. Dense banks generated low oxygen conditions in the inter-algal water (0–1 mg l−1), corresponding to zones of high, and relatively stable, phosphate and ammonium concentrations (up to 96 μg l−1 PO4P and 166 μg l−1 NH4N). Laboratory experiments confirmed that macroalgal banks can generate reducing conditions at the sediment surface, regardless of the aeration regime, through the decomposition of macroalgal tissue. Platinum electrode potentials as low as −200 mV were recorded in the inter-algal water. In such banks, redox-dependent sediment nutrient release and anaerobic accumulation of nitrogen accounted for inter-algal nutrient concentrations of over 60 μg l−1 phosphate and 800 μg l−1 ammonium.The generation of reducing conditions in inter-algal water required 7 days of still conditions and so this mechanism of nutrient generation is unlikely to be important in winter, when strong winds frequently shift the algal banks. It is suggested that in summer this mechanism may provide a source of nutrients to dense algal banks, supplementing reserves stored in winter.}},

In situ quantification of bioturbation can be achieved in a myriad of ways, requiring expert knowledge, technology, and resources not always available, and not feasible in some settings. Where dedicated research programmes do not exist, a practical alternative is the adoption of a trait-based approach to estimate community bioturbation potential (BPc). This index can be calculated from inventories of species, abundance and biomass data (routinely available for many systems), and a functional classification of organism traits associated with sediment mixing (less available). Presently, however, there is no agreed standard categorization for the reworking mode and mobility of benthic species. Based on information from the literature and expert opinion, we provide a functional classification for 1033 benthic invertebrate species from the northwest European continental shelf, as a tool to enable the standardized calculation of BPc in the region. Future uses of this classification table will increase the comparability and utility of large-scale assessments of ecosystem processes and functioning influenced by bioturbation (e.g., to support legislation). The key strengths, assumptions, and limitations of BPc as a metric are critically reviewed, offering guidelines for its calculation and application.}},

For example, Rincon Bayou, Texas, U.S.A. is an estuary stressed by large fluctuations in salinity ranging from oligohaline to hypersaline conditions; leading to the question: are benthic succession dynamics interrupted or affected by the temporal scale of salinity fluctuations? To answer this question, succession dynamics were investigated by manipulation of 1) initial environmental conditions, and 2) time between severe disturbances. The influence of environmental conditions and time course of succession were investigated by comparing two experiments. A synoptic-deployment experiment where samples were deployed at the same environmental conditions and a synoptic-retrieval experiment where samples were collected from deployments under different environmental conditions. Both experiments were conducted at varying time courses of 2-, 4- and 8-week durations between severe disturbances. Severe disturbances were simulated with defaunated sediment. Ambient conditions were simultaneously sampled as a reference. Environmental conditions directly affected succession. In the ambient study, succession occurred in conjunction with changes in environmental conditions. In the synoptic-deployment and synoptic-retrieval studies, environmental conditions at the time of retrieval were more important in determining community structure than deployment duration or initial environmental conditions at time of deployment. Initial environmental conditions were not the primary mechanism in regulation of succession because succession is likely interrupted by frequent salinity disturbances. The salinity-stressed estuary of Rincon Bayou appears to be in a constant state of early and intermediate succession because of frequent salinity-related disturbances.}},

Generally the abundance of deposit feeders during winter and spring is related to an increase in the nutritive value of the sediment due to the concurrent microalgal peaks. This work investigated, in 1998, the seasonal variability patterns in the nutritive value of the sediment and in the abundance of two polychaetes, Desdemona ornata (Sabellidae: Fabriicinae) and Perinereis cultrifera (Nereididae), that probably feed on benthic microalgae. Previously, in 1997, these two species were abundant in winter and spring. During that winter, the amount of chlorophyll a in the sediment was quite variable due to grazing activities. Three manipulative field experiments were carried out in winter and spring (January, March and April 1998) to test the hypothesis that increasing the amount of chlorophyll a increases the nutritional value of the sediment and the abundance of Perinereis cultrifera and Desdemona ornata. The results indicated that the patterns of variability for these species and for chlorophyll a were similar to those observed in 1997. In plots where microalgal growth was stimulated experimentally, Perinereis cultrifera increased in January and Desdemona ornata increased in January and March. The role of food in regulating the abundances of Perinereis cultrifera and Desdemona ornata is discussed.}},

The biomass in these sediments is dominated by macrofauna, a grouping of invertebrate polychaetes, molluscs, crustaceans and other phyla based on size. Globally, only a small portion of marine habitats have been sampled for macrofauna, but sampled areas have led to global estimates of macrofaunal species number ranging from 500,000 to 10,000,000. Most of these species are undescribed, and global syntheses of patterns of individual taxa and biodiversity are few and based on limited samples. The significance of biodiversity in marine sediments to ecosystem processes is poorly understood, but individual species and functional groups are known to carry out activities that have global importance. Macrofaunal activity impacts global carbon, nitrogen and sulphur cycling, transport, burial and metabolism of pollutants, secondary production including commercial species, and transport of sediments. Documented extinctions of marine macrofauna are few, but the ramifications of species loss through habitat shrinkage and undocumented extinctions are unknown. Limited data suggest there is substantial functional redundancy in macrofauna within trophic groups but whether this redundancy is sufficient to allow species loss without significantly altering ecosystem processes is unknown. Sorely needed are experiments that test specific hypotheses on biodiversity, redundancy, and ecosystem processes as they relate to marine macrofauna.}},

Differences and similarities between various approaches and models are highlighted and the P–R and G–P models are unified under a single conceptual framework of habitat saprobity in coastal lagoons. We refer to saprobity as the state of an aquatic ecosystem resulting from the input and decomposition of OM and the removal of its catabolites. In addition to other factors, such as salinity, saprobity is viewed as a selection factor for species diversity. The higher the saprobity is, the more impaired the system is, with progressively poorer benthic communities characterized by species that are increasingly tolerant of reducing conditions and toxicity. In coastal lagoons, these processes are strongly driven by hydrodynamics, which govern the land–sea gradient. Based on our review and analysis, we find that saprobity can be a useful descriptor of ecosystem state as determined by OM metabolism, suitable for characterizing the natural conditions of coastal lagoons and assessing their quality.}},

Using the AMBI database, species ecological group scores are shown to be coherent within families. Faunal data from a wide range of environmental impact scenarios in the north-eastern Atlantic demonstrate that AMBI, calculated from mean values for families, exhibits a strong linear relationship with species-level AMBI, the correlation improving by using square-root transformed rather than untransformed abundances. In many regions of the world, however, the sensitivity of benthic macroinvertebrates to environmental perturbations is unknown, precluding the use of AMBI for environmental assessments. Yet the families are essentially the same as in the AMBI database. The utility of family-level AMBI is tested using data for four south-western Australian estuaries previously subjected to environmental quality assessments, but where only 17 species of the 144 taxa are included in the AMBI database. Although family-level AMBI scores reflect differences in environmental quality spatially and temporally within an estuary, they do not follow variations in environmental quality among estuaries. Indeed, south-western Australia estuaries are numerically dominated by families with high AMBI scores, probably due to the detrimental effects of natural accumulations of organic material in estuaries with long residence times. As taxonomic distinctness follows trends in environmental quality among estuaries, as well as temporally and spatially within a system, it provides an appropriate substitute for assessing the ‘heath’ of microtidal estuaries.}},

Responses were compared at the fish community level (species composition; 1978–2009 in the shallows and 1993–2009 in deeper waters) and at the population and individual levels of an estuarine indicator species, black bream Acanthopagrus butcheri (biomass–abundance and per capita mass at age, respectively; 1993–2009). All three levels showed distinct shifts from earlier to later periods, but their patterns, sensitivity and breadth differed. Community composition changed markedly in the shallows of the lower-middle estuary between the late 1970s and all later periods and moderately between more disparate periods from 1995 to 2009. Several species trends could be linked to the increasing salinity of the estuary or declining dissolved oxygen levels in its middle–upper reaches. Community changes were, however, small or insignificant in the shallow and deeper waters of the upper estuary and deeper waters of the middle estuary, where environmental perturbations are often most pronounced. This may reflect the resilience of the limited suite of species that typify those reaches and thus their lack of sensitivity in reflecting longer-term change at the coarser level of mean abundance. One such species, the selected indicator, A. butcheri, did, however, show marked temporal changes at both the population and individual levels. Biomass decreased markedly in deeper waters while increasing in the shallows from earlier to later periods, presumably reflecting an onshore movement of fish, and per capita body mass in the 2+, 3+ and 4+ year classes fell steadily over time. Such changes probably indicate deteriorating habitat quality in the deeper waters. The study outcomes provide support for a multifaceted approach to the biomonitoring of estuaries using fishes and highlight the need for complementary monitoring of relevant stressors to better disentangle cause–effect pathways.}},

abstract = {{A multimetric benthic index of biotic integrity (B-IBI) was developed using data from five Chesapeake Bay sampling programs conducted between 1972 and 1991. Attributes of the index were selected by comparing the response of 17 candidate measures of benthic condition (metrics) between a set of minimally affected reference sites and at all other sites for which data were available. This procedure was conducted independently for each of seven habitats defined by salinity and substrate. Fifteen of the 17 candidate metrics differed significantly between reference sites and other sites for at least one habitat. No metric differed significantly in all seven habitats; however, four metrics, species diversity, abundance, biomass, and percent of abundance as pollution-indicative taxa, differed in six habitats. The index was calculated by scoring each selected metric as 5, 3, or 1 depending on whether its value at a site approximated, deviated slightly from, or deviated greatly from conditions at the best reference sites. Validation based on independent data collected between 1992 and 1994 indicated that the index correctly distinguished stressed sites from reference sites 93\% of the time, with the highest validation rates occurring in high salinity habitats.}},

Species composition differed significantly among habitats in each season, with the greatest differences occurring in winter and spring and the least in summer. The pattern of habitat differences, as defined by their enduring environmental characteristics, was significantly and well matched with that in the fauna in each season. In contrast, significant matches between the non-enduring environmental and faunal data were only detected in winter and/or spring, and to a lesser extent. Field validation of the faunal prediction capacity of the biophysical surrogate framework at various ‘test’ sites throughout the estuary showed good agreement between the actual vs predicted key species. These findings demonstrate that enduring environmental criteria, which can be readily measured from mapped data, provide a better and more cost-effective surrogate for explaining spatial differences in the invertebrate fauna of this system than non-enduring criteria, and are thus a promising basis for faunal prediction. The approaches developed in this study are also readily adapted to any estuary worldwide.}},

abstract = {{An artificial channel was opened in 1994 between the microtidal Peel–Harvey Estuary and the Indian Ocean to increase tidal exchange and thus ameliorate the problems of eutrophication. Although this greatly reduced macroalgal and cyanobacterial growths and the amount of particulate organic matter, our data indicate that, contrary to managerial expectations, the benthic environment has deteriorated. Thus, although macroinvertebrate density has declined as predicted, taxonomic distinctness (Δ∗) has also declined and species composition has become more variable. Macroinvertebrate composition has also changed markedly at the species, family and even phylum levels. The Crustacea, the most sensitive of the major macrobenthic taxa to environmental stress, has become proportionally less abundant and speciose, whereas the Polychaeta, the least sensitive, was unique in showing the reverse trend. The benthos of the Peel–Harvey Estuary is thus apparently more stressed than previously, probably due to the multiple effects of a great increase in system use.}},
