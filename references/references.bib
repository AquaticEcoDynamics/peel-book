abstract = {{Rivers draining coastal-plain soils with a low phosphorus-binding capacity load nutrients into the estuarine system in winter. Phosphorus is largely trapped by diatom blooms and recycled via the sediments to support growth, during the warmer months, of blue-green algae in Harvey Estuary or macroalgae in Peel Inlet. The magnitude of blue-green algae (Nodularia) blooms is related to the amount of river water entering in winter; blooms collapse as salinities rise toward that of the ocean. For macroalgae the relationship between light and nutrient availability is of critical importance. Control measures are concerned with reducing phosphorus loads from catchments and increasing water exchange with the ocean through the proposed construction of a new channel.}},

abstract = {{Seagrasses and macroalgae provide ecosystem services that are imperative to human survival and well-being. The provision of habitat for fisheries species is one of these ecosystem services. Indeed, much of the world's fisheries species depend on seagrasses and macroalgae for food, shelter, protection from predators, and as a nursery ground during their juvenile stages of development. This chapter gives a brief introduction to seagrass and macroalgal biology and ecology, including their diversity and evolution, current distribution and production and reproduction ecology. It will also highlight their ecosystem functions, particularly emphasizing their importance to fisheries and aquaculture. The chapter then explores how climate change is predicted to have (or already is having) an effect of seagrass and macroalgal distribution, heath and resilience as well as how these changes may ultimately affect their ability to function within an ecosystem. Lastly, it will delve into how these climate change-related disturbances may impact global fisheries, including case studies demonstrating possible outcome of bottom–up cascades.}},

issn = {1442-9993}, 
doi = {10.1111/j.1442-9993.2001.01070.pp.x}, 
abstract = {{Hypothesis-testing methods for multivariate data are needed to make rigorous probability statements about the effects of factors and their interactions in experiments. Analysis of variance is particularly powerful for the analysis of univariate data. The traditional multivariate analogues, however, are too stringent in their assumptions for most ecological multivariate data sets. Non-parametric methods, based on permutation tests, are preferable. This paper describes a new non-parametric method for multivariate analysis of variance, after McArdle and Anderson (in press). It is given here, with several applications in ecology, to provide an alternative and perhaps more intuitive formulation for ANOVA (based on sums of squared distances) to complement the description provided by McArdle and Anderson (in press) for the analysis of any linear model. It is an improvement on previous non-parametric methods because it allows a direct additive partitioning of variation for complex models. It does this while maintaining the flexibility and lack of formal assumptions of other non-parametric methods. The test-statistic is a multivariate analogue to Fisher’s F-ratio and is calculated directly from any symmetric distance or dissimilarity matrix. P-values are then obtained using permutations. Some examples of the method are given for tests involving several factors, including factorial and hierarchical (nested) designs and tests of interactions.}},

Attributes of the index were selected by comparing the response of 17 candidate measures of benthic condition (metrics) between a set of minimally affected reference sites and at all other sites for which data were available. This procedure was conducted independently for each of seven habitats defined by salinity and substrate. Fifteen of the 17 candidate metrics differed significantly between reference sites and other sites for at least one habitat. No metric differed significantly in all seven habitats; however, four metrics, species diversity, abundance, biomass, and percent of abundance as pollution-indicative taxa, differed in six habitats. The index was calculated by scoring each selected metric as 5, 3, or 1 depending on whether its value at a site approximated, deviated slightly from, or deviated greatly from conditions at the best reference sites. Validation based on independent data collected between 1992 and 1994 indicated that the index correctly distinguished stressed sites from reference sites 93\% of the time, with the highest validation rates occurring in high salinity habitats.}},
