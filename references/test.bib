  abstract  = "Abstract. The effects of changes in catchment nutrient loading
               and composition on the phytoplankton dynamics, development of
               hypoxia and internal nutrient dynamics in a stratified coastal
               lagoon system (the Gippsland Lakes) were investigated using a
               3-D coupled hydrodynamic biogeochemical water quality model. The
               study showed that primary production was equally sensitive to
               changed dissolved inorganic and particulate organic nitrogen
               loads, highlighting the need for a better understanding of
               particulate organic matter bioavailability. Stratification and
               sediment carbon enrichment were the main drivers for the hypoxia
               and subsequent sediment phosphorus release in Lake King. High
               primary production stimulated by large nitrogen loading brought
               on by a winter flood contributed almost all the sediment carbon
               deposition (as opposed to catchment loads), which was ultimately
               responsible for summer bottom-water hypoxia. Interestingly,
               internal recycling of phosphorus was more sensitive to changed
               nitrogen loads than total phosphorus loads, highlighting the
               potential importance of nitrogen loads exerting a control over
               systems that become phosphorus limited (such as during summer
               nitrogen-fixing blooms of cyanobacteria). Therefore, the current
               study highlighted the need to reduce both total nitrogen and
               total phosphorus for water quality improvement in estuarine
               systems.",
