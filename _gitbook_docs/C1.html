<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>Seagrass and macroalgal communities (‘macrophytes’) play key roles in the function of estuaries and the societal benefits they provide. Over more recent history, the macrophytes of the Peel-Harvey, and especially the green macroalgae, have been a major focus due to the massive blooms that occurred from the 1960s–1980s and the ecological and societal issues that resulted. Opening of the Dawesville Cut in 1994 to help alleviate these problems led to a major step change in the estuary’s hydrology and nutrient levels. There have also been other more gradual shifts in the estuarine environment from catchment development and climate change effects, particularly in recent decades.</p>
<p>This report explores how the macrophyte community in the Peel-Harvey has changed over the last 40 years (1978–2018), and the environmental drivers that have been most influential. While other studies have examined changes in these plant communities in particular periods (e.g. just before and after the Cut), this is the first to examine the full sampling record. We also developed an index of macrophyte community condition or ‘health,’ which was translated into a report card scale from ‘A’ (excellent) to ‘E’ (very poor), and used it to track changes over time across the estuary. Lastly, we propose a macrophyte monitoring plan for the future. This report provides a broad summary of our key findings, and is supplemented by a more detailed and technical account in Krumholz (2019).</p>
<p>Our findings show there have been dramatic changes in the macrophyte community from the late 1970s, which in most regions of the estuary has reflected major declines in green macroalgae and increases in seagrass. These shifts were most obvious just after the Cut and the subsequent boost in tidal flushing. The most recent survey results (2017–2018) show that, for the first time in the monitoring record, the community is clearly dominated by seagrass (70% of overall biomass in autumn 2018) as opposed to green macroalgae (52–86% of overall biomass from 1978–1994). This progression has led to improved health of the macrophyte community, from very poor to fair (index grade E–C) across much of the estuary in 1985–1989, to fair to excellent (grade C–A) in 2018.</p>
<p>One region of the estuary that is not showing signs of improvement is the southern Harvey Estuary. The macrophytes in this shallow and poorly flushed region remain in poor condition and are showing worrying signs with respect to increases in nuisance green macroalgae. While average green algal biomass decreased from the late 1970s to just after the Cut in this region, it has increased in more recent years, especially in spring when it far exceeds values recorded for any other macrophyte group across the whole estuary in the full 40 year timeframe. The shallow south-eastern Peel Inlet also has a high biomass of green macroalgae, again especially in spring, which has largely persisted throughout the monitoring record and even increased in recent years.</p>
<p>The main environmental driver of the above longer-term shifts in the macrophyte community was the concentration of total nitrogen in the water column. Green algal-dominated assemblages were generally linked with higher nitrogen concentrations, and more seagrass-dominated assemblages were linked with lower concentrations. Some weaker correlations were also found with increasing salinities and temperatures, as well as decreasing total phosphorus concentrations.</p>
<p>A more detailed study of the macrophytes across the estuary in spring 2017 and autumn 2018 found 23 species in total (over a third of which were red macroalgae), which has increased from the last comparable survey in 2009 (14 species in spring 2009 vs 18 species in spring 2017). Based on biomass, seagrass clearly dominates the 2017–2018 community (56% on average), most of which is Ruppia sp. and occurs mainly in the northern Harvey Estuary and parts of Peel Inlet. Not only has the seagrass contribution increased since spring 2009 (38% vs 60% in spring 2017), but the dominant seagrass species has changed from Zostera sp. to Ruppia sp. As for the long-term macrophyte data, the changes in the 2017–2018 community from more seagrass-dominated assemblages in the northern half of the system to a more green algal-dominated one in the southern Harvey Estuary, were best linked with an increase in total nitrogen, and to a lesser extent total phosphorus.</p>
<p>To better assess the ongoing health and environmental drivers of this macrophyte community, and if its recent move towards seagrass domination reflects a stable shift, it is imperative that a consistent and regular macrophyte monitoring program is implemented, alongside other environmental monitoring of the estuary. The broad monitoring regime we have proposed can be tailored to suit resourcing.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">0.1</span> Background</h2>
<p>Macroalgal and seagrass communities are one of the most visual elements of the Peel-Harvey biota. These submerged plant communities (collectively referred to as ‘macrophytes’) play pivotal roles in estuarine ecosystems and are key indicators of environmental condition. Healthy macrophyte communities provide many ecosystem services, including <em>supporting functions</em> such as primary production and carbon sequestration, <em>provisioning functions</em> such as food and habitat for many fauna, and <em>regulating functions</em> such as sediment and shoreline stabilisation. These, in turn, support many <em>societal values</em> such as productive fisheries, wildlife watching opportunities and safer coastal environments that better mitigate threats such as bank erosion and flooding. Macrophytes are also good indicators of water quality, reflecting key aspects such as nutrient availability, salinity and turbidity. Seagrass-dominated communities, as opposed to those which are algal-dominated (and particularly by fast-growing green algae), typically reflect healthier estuarine ecosystems (e.g. Macreadie et al., 2018).</p>
<p>The Peel-Harvey became iconic throughout the 1960s–1980s for its extreme nutrient enrichment and associated macroalgal bloom issues (McComb et al., 1981). Thick blankets of green algae, dominated by <em>Willeella brachyclados</em> (previously <em>Cladophora montagneana</em>) and <em>Chaetomorpha linum</em>, covered Peel Inlet and some parts of Harvey Estuary, leading to massive accumulations of rotting weed. Seagrass also retracted due to algal smothering (Hodgkin et al., 1981; Bradby, 1997). The Dawesville Channel (‘Cut’) built in 1994 to help mitigate these algal blooms through increased tidal flushing certainly led to major shifts in the hydrology and nutrient levels of the estuary. Hydrodynamic modelling undertaken in other parts of the Linkage Project has shown, for example, that the Cut reduced water retention time in autumn from ~100 to 50 days in Peel Inlet and from ~150–200 to 50–80 days in Harvey Estuary (Huang et al., 2019). There have also been other, more incremental shifts in estuarine condition since the Cut opened 25 years ago, mainly through ongoing catchment development and climate change (Valesini et al., 2019). Under our increasingly drier climate, for example, water retention times have now increased back towards pre-Cut levels in some parts of the estuary (Huang et al., 2019).</p>
<p>This study has collated existing long-term monitoring data of macrophyte biomass across the estuary basins, and undertaken new surveys of the macrophyte community, to produce a data set spanning four decades from 1978 to 2018. While there are several gaps in the monitoring record, this data provides a rare opportunity to explore how the seagrass and macroalgal communities of the Peel-Harvey have changed over the last 40 years, covering periods in the height of the macroalgal bloom issues, those just before and after the Cut, then more recent ones. Although some previous studies have examined changes in these plant communities in select years, e.g. before (1985–1991) and after (1994–1999) the Cut (Wilson et al., 1999), and in 2009 (Pedretti et al., 2009), this is the <strong><em>first to examine changes over the full sampling record, as well as statistically explore their environmental drivers.</em></strong> We also develop a simple <strong><em>index of macrophyte condition (‘health’)</em></strong>, and propose a <strong><em>monitoring plan</em></strong> for the future. The specific objectives are as follows.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">0.3.2</span> Collating the long-term data sets</h3>
<p>Macrophyte biomass has been sampled in various years from 1978 to 2018 throughout the basins of the Peel-Harvey Estuary. To help with exploring long-term trends in the macrophyte community, sampling years were grouped into <em>interannual ‘periods’</em>, which typically contained four-six years, except in the more recent times when they contained one or two years. A summary of this long-term sampling regime is provided in Table 1 and a map of the sites that were sampled regularly is in shown in Fig. 1. This map also shows the estuarine regions (southern and northern Harvey Estuary; western and eastern Peel Inlet) and water depth category (shallow &lt;1.5 m; deep &gt;1.5 m) to which sites were assigned. Aside from 2017–2018, when sampling was undertaken as part of the current ARC Linkage Project (see section 4.2), all surveys were carried out by the Marine and Freshwater Research Laboratory (MAFRL) at Murdoch University (e.g. Wilson et al., 1999; Pedretti et al., 2011).</p>
<p>Macrophyte surveys over the last 40 years have varied in the (i) frequency and timing during any one year (one–four times per year), (ii) number of sites sampled (30 to 51 sites) and (iii) resolution to which macrophyte taxa were identified, i.e. fine (species or genus ) vs broad (phylum or division; Table 1). To maximise data consistency between years, as well as the number of years that could be included for analysis, the data were harmonised in the following ways.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>As <em>autumn and spring</em> were the most frequently sampled seasons across years, only data collected at these times of year were used. Long-term trends were examined separately for each of these seasons because of differences in their sampling regimes (Table 1), and because macrophyte growth often changes seasonally in response to environmental changes.</p></li>
<li><p>Only data collected from <em>regularly sampled sites</em> (i.e. visited in at least five of the sampling years) were included in the data set, i.e. those shown in Fig. 1.</p></li>
<li><p>Only <em>broad groups of macrophyte taxa</em> (i.e. seagrass; green macroalgae; brown macroalgae; red macroalgae; charophytes) were examined across all sampling years, since this was the extent to which taxonomic classifications were consistently recorded from 1978–2000.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to the long-term macrophyte dataset, complementary data on various <em>water quality parameters</em> known to influence macrophyte growth (see below) were also collated from the weekly to monthly measurements made at six routine water monitoring sites throughout the estuary since 1977 by the Department of Water and Environmental Regulation (DWER) and other agencies such as MAFRL (see Fig. 1). Measurements recorded at the water surface and bottom for the following parameters were collated for each of the years and seasons (autumn and spring) in which macrophytes were sampled. Surface measurements were matched with nearby shallow macrophyte sites, and bottom measurements were matched with nearby deeper sites.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Salinity</p></li>
<li><p>Water temperature (°C)</p></li>
<li><p>Turbidity, and particularly the extent to which light penetrates to the estuary bottom (reflected by Secchi depth scaled to a proportion of total water depth, i.e. 0, clear waters; 1, completely turbid)</p></li>
<li><p>Total phosphorus concentration (µg L<sup>−1</sup>)    </p></li>
<li><p>Total nitrogen concentration (µg L<sup>−1</sup>)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, to help with detecting any ‘growth response’ by the macrophytes to preceding water quality conditions, water measurements recorded over the two months prior to each macrophyte
sampling event were also collated, and used to create a ‘time lag’ data set.</p>
<p>Note that, due to some inconsistencies in the water quality monitoring record when not all of the above parameters were measured when macrophytes were sampled, some years had to be excluded from both data sets, i.e. 1978 in autumn and 1981 in spring (Table 1).</p>
