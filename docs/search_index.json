The framework reported is used to assess a series of scenarios that were designed after a stakeholder consultation process. These scenarios represented alternate future (2050) “storylines” that depicted different estuary health states, catchment development and management approaches and climate conditions for the Peel-Harvey system. These diverse views were synthesised into three main narratives (referred to as ‘environmentally optimistic,’ ‘business as usual’ and ‘environmentally pessimistic’) and translated into coupled catchment-estuary model simulations. A range of novel environmental and economic indicators were then employed to assess the scenarios relative to a ‘base case’ (current conditions). From an environmental point of view, the scenarios tested show the overwhelming influence of a future dry climate on the flow of water to the estuary. While flows and nutrient loads are reduced, the flow-weighted nutrient concentrations remained fairly constant between matched land use scenarios that were subject to the two different climatic conditions. Catchment management actions were able to reduce the nutrients entering the estuary, with the most “environmentally optimistic” scenario able to reduce flow-weighted nitrogen by 24% and flow-weighted phosphorus by 69% compared to current conditions. The effect of climate change and land-use change for each scenario were compared by assessing the resulting differences in a range of water quality and ecosystem health indices. These indices also highlighted the relatively large change brought about by climate change (including sea level rise and catchment drying) into the future, which has the potential to significantly alter aspects of estuary condition, particularly on the eastern side of the basins and into the riverine reaches. Whilst some indices reported future benefits in some regions, overall the predictions indicated a more stressed system into the future and particularly exacerbated problems with hypoxia and harmful algal blooms in the rivers. The environmentally optimistic scenario did highlight, however, the potential benefit of sound catchment management on reducing negative impacts on the estuary and can help the adaptation process towards a drier future. The detailed model outputs are extensive and can be used to assist understanding of local changes and prioritise monitoring and management strategies. The scenarios were also assessed in terms of economic health. The framework for assessing economic health indicators is based on outputs from an econometrics model used to assess the historical and current regional job growth data. As such, the economic assessment did not seek to model long-term economic activity of individual sectors, but rather to provide a “systems view” of whether proposed stressors or actions would enhance economic specialisation, industry-linkages and job growth. Core indicators assessed for each scenario were therefore related to the comparative and competitive advantage of the regional economy, and a qualitative assessment of each indicator was made. To provide a holistic view of the relative environmental and economic status of each scenario, a further framework for supporting high-level decision-making was developed, able to link the varied drivers, pressures, actions, impacts and responses with locally relevant environmental quality and economic resilience indicators. The framework was applied to the three main stakeholder-led scenarios to demonstrate the trade-offs of decisions in a logical and transparent way. The assessment of the chosen scenarios highlights that actions to manage the health of the estuary can support long-term economic resilience by increasing export orientation and diversification. The newly developed framework shows potential for more widespread adoption for harmonising adaptation strategies between organisations by providing a common assessment approach for managing future risks. Further effort is required to operationalise the system in consultation with stakeholders. 8.2 Background People and estuaries are inextricably linked. These productive, safe and striking environments have long been attractive places to settle or visit for the vast societal benefits they provide, such as food, protection, environmental buffering, lifestyles, livelihoods and connection to place. However, exploitation of their resources and the vast downstream impacts of over-development of their catchments has led to estuaries becoming among the most degraded of all aquatic ecosystems, in turn threatening societal health in their vicinity and beyond. This close and reciprocal connection necessitates a socio-ecological view of these complex ecosystems, with the central question being how do we best maintain the benefits provided by healthy estuaries, while also meeting the needs of our growing populations and developing potential to grow economic opportunities? Successfully striking a balance or acceptable tradeoffs for the above question is a global issue, yet the pathways to achieving it are often poorly understood, rarely defined and seldom quantified. In part, this reflects the complexities and unpredictability of both estuaries and societies across multiple scales. It also reflects the fact that management of socio-ecological systems requires long-term thinking, yet the future is uncertain and our ability to learn from hindsight is often hampered by patchy long-term observations (Polasky et al., 2011; Carpenter et al., 2015). One way of dealing with these challenges, and offering informed insights into the socio-ecological tradeoffs we may have to navigate in the foreseeable future, is the process of scenario development. Scenarios are plausible stories about how the future may unfold based on known patterns, new or anticipated drivers, or alternative societal choices. Scenarios aren’t predictions, but rather they are alternative futures that explore different trajectories of change and possibilities for adaptation (Raskin 2005; Mahmoud et al., 2009). Scenario analysis connects stakeholder-led storylines about the socio-ecological futures of most interest, with key supporting drivers that can ideally be quantified (e.g. land-use mosaics, climate) and used as inputs for predictive models that can capture the complexity of the human-natural system based on available evidence. This enables simulations about how the system is likely to respond from multiple perspectives and in turn an ability to assess trade-offs, allowing decision-making to be tailored towards desired outcomes. This general process of scenario analysis has been used to guide strategic planning at the catchment scale in various cases around the world, albeit with differing objectives, supporting drivers, assessment methods and assumptions (e.g. Mahmoud et al., 2009; Bryan et al., 2011; Carpenter et al., 2015, Booth et al., 2016). The Peel-Harvey Estuary and its regional community provides a rich opportunity to explore forward-looking scenarios that help distil the core elements of sustainability across this complex system, and guide smarter development choices that support this fast-growing region yet minimise downstream impacts on its largest natural asset. The catchment-estuary system has rich environmental and ecological historical data sets, in some cases dating back to the 1970s, that have been brought together and supplemented with extensive field sampling under the current ARC Linkage Project (e.g. Huang et al., 2019; Hallett et al., 2019; Valesini et al., 2019). Further work within the Linkage on local economic activity and the relative influence of external economic drivers, supplements our socio-economic understanding of the Peel region (Plummer et al., 2019). Importantly, the coupled catchment-estuary model developed under other components of the Linkage (Huang et al., 2019; Hipsey et al., 2019) provides the framework for synthesising the biophysical complexity of the system, and translating scenario storylines (via underpinning drivers) into expected estuary health responses. Aside from the above knowledge and capabilities, a further key part of the opportunity provided by the Peel-Harvey is the interest and investment by a diverse range of stakeholders in the future wellbeing of the region, both from ecological and socio-economic development perspectives. In line with timelines for broader regional land planning and development directions proposed for the Peel by the State and Commonwealth governments to accommodate projected population increases (Strategic Assessment of the Perth and Peel Regions-‘SAPPR,’ released in 2015 as the Draft Perth and Peel Green Growth Plan for 3.5 million [Government of Western Australia, 2015] and currently under review), the future horizon we have selected for our socio-ecological scenarios of the Peel-Harvey is 2050. The main objectives of this project component are as follows. 8.3 Objectives Identify which socio-ecological scenarios about the Peel-Harvey in 2050 are of most interest to Peel stakeholders to explore. Translate each of the key scenario narratives into input data and parameters used by the coupled estuary-catchment model. Forecast how key indices reflecting both estuary health and the broader societal health of the Peel region are likely to respond under each 2050 scenario, relative to the present (‘base case’). Summarise the anticipated socio-ecological trade-offs under each 2050 scenario. 8.4 Approach 8.4.1 Identifying key stakeholder values and 2050 scenarios 8.4.2 Initial stakeholder workshop A half-day workshop was held in June 2018 and attended by ~25 participants representing different management (State-local), community or scientific agencies with interests in the health of the Peel-Harvey Estuary and/or development of the Peel region. The main aims of the workshop were to understand, looking towards a future horizon of 2050, which (1) values were most important to maintain and (2) plausible scenarios (or ‘stories’) were most important to explore. In providing their answers, stakeholders were asked to consider both the ecosystem health of the Peel-Harvey Estuary, and the socio-economic health of the broader Peel region. An introductory presentation was first provided to outline the scenario concept, beginning with a plausible story or narrative, then how this descriptive information could be translated into underpinning quantitative drivers, which could be applied to biophysical models (being developed under the broader Linkage project; Huang et al., 2019; Hipsey et al., 2019; Kilminster et al., 2019) to predict response of the Peel-Harvey system from various perspectives (and particularly those reflecting stakeholder values). Comparison of system responses of interest would then enable trade-offs between them to be explored. A conceptual summary of this scenario approach is given in Figure 8.1. Workshop participants were then asked to anonymously complete a survey (see Appendix 1), considering what was important to them and their organisation more broadly, after guiding them through its main questions and their objectives. The four main questions in the survey were focused on the following: The most important values to sustain in 2050, from an estuary health perspective and regional social and economic perspectives. The 2050 scenarios that were most important to explore for their possible impacts on estuarine and/or societal health. This question had two parts. Describing plausible ‘what-if’ stories of 2050 scenarios. Identifying specific combinations of catchment land-uses and/or management practices, and their implementation level, of most interest Ranking aspirational goals for 2050. Specific 2050 estuary condition states (e.g. health status or environmental threshold) of most interest.
