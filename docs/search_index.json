Undertaken from 2016 to 2019, the research sought to develop an evidence-based approach to understand the links and trade-offs between regional catchment development (economic resilience) and the health of the receiving estuary (environmental and ecological resilience). Given the Peel-Harvey’s particular history of fundamental ecosystem shifts through both chronic decline and an acute engineered ‘recovery,’ combined with its current and forecast climate and development stressors, there has been an urgent need for a holistic view of this important socio-ecological system. This book summarises a series of ten studies that together document the changing environmental conditions, ecosystem character and socio-economic priorities of the system, and provides insight into possible future trajectories that can be used to inform sustainable development.

"],["ii-preface.html", "ii Preface", " ii Preface Whatever way we choose to look at it, or words we might choose to describe it, it is a global truth that the health of people is inseparably linked to that of their environment. There are fewer places where this foundational relationship is more apparent, and tested, than along our coastlines and estuarine waterways. Long having been magnets for human settlements given their vast productivity, access, travel routes and safe harbour, these environments have distilled over time the collective impacts of human development, modification and dependency for resources, livelihoods and lifestyles. And given their location on the frontline of many of the environmental shifts under climate change, our coastal environments also amplify the risks and transitions that come with rising sea levels, less rainfall and warmer temperatures, among other impacts. Invariably then, the most important question is how we maintain diverse and productive coastal ecosystems to help sustain our coastal communities in the face of escalating population growth and climate stressors. This question is particularly pertinent in the Australian context, given that more than 80% of our population lives within 50 km of the coast and is mainly concentrated within the catchments of large shallow estuaries situated on low-elevation coastlines. For the large part, we have built our culture, our identity and our way of life on our coasts and estuaries, and finding ways to sustain and most importantly adapt to these transitioning environments is key to our longevity. The central thesis of this book aims to advance understanding of this fundamental question, working within the context of the largest estuarine system in south-western Australia, the Peel-Harvey. For reasons outlined in the following chapters, there are many reasons why this vast catchment-estuarine system makes an excellent case study for this purpose. The work we have collated here grew from a desire to understand more about the linkages that drive an estuarine-catchment system, originally from an environmental-ecological perspective which then evolved to include another fundamental component of the ecosystem – it’s people. Through making and modelling those links, conceptually then quantitatively, our intent became one of how we might get better at forecasting potential futures and what we could do differently now to steer towards a future we want, rather than staying a on a path we got better at understanding but did too little about. To this end, the following document, which embodies a series of interconnected yet stand-alone studies as individual chapters, has been organised into the following sections that represent our journey throughout this three-year research project. Following an overarching synthesis, the first section on Characterising the Environment unpacks the development of a sophisticated catchment-estuary model and the data, existing and new, needed to build and validate this central framework. From the depths of the estuarine sediment to the dynamics and chemistry of its overlying water - including tracing the catchment origins, pathways and destination of nutrients in the receiving estuary - we spent considerable time and effort attempting to recreate the complex environmental functioning of the Peel-Harvey, both for the present and over its checkered history since the 1970s. The section on Estuarine Ecological Health then delves into fundamental ecological components from the benthic to pelagic, spanning in-depth studies from the 1970s to the present on the Peel-Harvey’s seagrass and macroalgal communities, benthic infauna and fish fauna. Importantly, these ecological studies endeavored to not simply report changes in community composition over space and time, but to synthesise key signals of their structural and functional health into simple ‘report-card’ grades that were then linked to environmental drivers. The Economic Health section focused on building an economic model for the Peel-Harvey and characterizing the ability of the region to create jobs locally and specialise economically. And finally, we sought in the Decision Support System and 2050 Scenarios section to integrate all of the above into a predictive framework for exploring the consequences on both ecological and economic resilience of particular catchment development and management decisions, both under current climate conditions and those anticipated for the region in 2050. Our local partners and stakeholders crafted the future scenarios they most wanted to understand for this vast ecosystem as we developed this final part of our research. This ambitious project certainly challenged us along the way. The diversity of disciplines and sectors it encompassed brought rich perspectives and vast capability, but also language barriers and ideological differences that needed to be navigated towards common ground. Data richness in some areas belied patchy or non-existent data in others, leading to innovations to sensibly deal with these data gaps or compromises where solutions could not be found. And more broadly, the difficulty of using data snapshots to capture enough of the complexity of these environments to reliably model their socio-ecological functions has since driven new innovations in other systems beyond this project, but which have borrowed heavily from the work we developed here. Finally, this collation of inter-linked studies is not intended as a finished product – rather, it’s a framework to keep building on and refining over time as more data streams and areas of interest develop. We have, however, significantly advanced the understanding – and practice – of the linkages we set out to make for the Peel-Harvey and other catchment-estuarine ecosystems facing similar challenges and opportunities, now and into our coastal futures.

This document summarises findings from a multi-disciplinary research project funded by the Australian Research Council (ARC; LP15010045) and delivered by nine linkage partners, led by Murdoch University. Undertaken from 2016 to 2019 within the Peel-Harvey region in south-western Australia, we sought to develop an evidence-based approach to understand the links and trade-offs between regional catchment development (economic resilience) and the health of the receiving estuary (environmental and ecological resilience). Given the Peel-Harvey’s particular history of fundamental ecosystem shifts through both chronic decline and an acute engineered ‘recovery,’ combined with its current and forecast climate and development stressors, there is an urgent need for a holistic view of this important socio-ecological system that can be used to inform sustainable development. The project objectives were to: Develop indices of estuarine and societal ‘health’ Establish historical trends and health status Establish current condition and health status Build a comprehensive modelling and theoretical framework to power a Decision Support System (DSS) Explore current and future socio-ecological tradeoffs through scenario assessment The project led to numerous detailed technical and scientific reports, which in entirety have significantly advanced our understanding of how the Peel-Harvey estuary works, the surrounding catchment and economy, and how it has changed over five decades. In addition to extensive primary data collection on estuarine condition (hydrology, ecology and biogeochemistry), project tasks also included developing comprehensive environmental models for the catchment and estuary, an econometric model, and a conceptual management framework linking economic activity and environmental quality. This report provides a high-level summary of findings and recommendations suited for the local community and policy-makers. Several key take-home messages are identified from the research in this report: Our learnings from the past and understanding of the present - The Cut and climate change have led to constant change in estuarine hydrology. The relative rate of nutrient retention and balance of estuary ‘metabolism’ has been responding since the Cut to changes in catchment inputs. Ecologically, the estuary is showing signs of trouble. The deeper Murray River, southern Harvey Estuary and shallows of south-eastern Peel Inlet have emerged as ‘trouble hot-spots’, both environmentally and ecologically. The community values healthy waterways as an important contributor to economic growth in the region. A future Peel-Harvey - The projected future drying climate is expected to have an overwhelming influence on water flows to the estuary, concentrating poor water quality and ecological problems in the rivers. Implementing extensive catchment management actions can significantly reduce nutrient flows to the estuary, and serve as a way to adapt to the drying trend. Continuing with a ‘business as usual’ approach to catchment management is expected to lead to further declines in estuarine heath. Based on the analysis, four high-level recommendations are made: There is a need to increase the scale and diversity of catchment and estuary management - the time for adaptation to growing stressors is now. Ongoing monitoring of estuarine ecology, water quality, sediment condition and human use is required to track estuary health and the most effective management interventions. Plan for development that can support economic growth, without increasing the overall water and nutrient footprint. Continued effort to develop and operationalise the DSS and manage new data streams, is required to support scenario assessment and provide transparency in decision-making for sustainable development. It is has been the objective of this project that the data, tools, knowledge and recommendations can all be directly applied to help support the ongoing management challenges facing the Peel-Harvey waterways. We also hope that it can serve to motivate new ideas for ways to preserve the inherent socio-environmental values, and restore degraded elements of the system, to ensure it can remain healthy for generations to come. 1.1 Background 1.1.1 Overview The overarching goal of this ARC Linkage project (2016-2019) was to produce an integrated, decision support system (DSS) for better understanding tradeoffs between regional catchment development drivers (economic resilience) and the health of receiving estuarine waterways (environmental and ecological resilience). Understanding these tradeoffs and exploring alternative futures around them is fundamental to sustainably developing our coastal regions. If a balance can be achieved, then broader societal resilience can be realised, reflecting the societal benefits that develop from both a healthy economy (e.g. more jobs, specialised industries) and healthy waterways (e.g. good fishing, wildlife watching, connection to place; Fig. 1.1). Figure 1.1: Conceptual diagram of the balance between catchment development aspirations (economic resilience) and downstream estuarine health (ecological resilience) to achieve broader social resilience. Yet, despite the increasing challenges brought about by accelerated population growth, much of which is occurring along our coasts and estuaries, the pathways to achieving this duality are either unclear or poorly considered. This partly reflects the complexities of both societies and our coastal waterways across multiple scales. It also reflects the fact that good management of these socio-ecological systems requires long-term thinking and ongoing support, integration of diverse and high-resolution information streams, co-operation among disparate stakeholder groups, and the focusing of multidisciplinary skill sets on a common set of goals. Added to this complexity at local to regional scales, are the shifting external baselines that influence our economies and environments at broader scales, such as global economic drivers and climate change. This ARC Linkage Project sought to tackle some of the above challenges by producing a logical decision-support framework that can be used to identify the most sustainable development choices at a regional scale, focusing on the Peel-Harvey estuary-catchment system in south-western Australia. The Peel-Harvey provides an ideal test case for deepening our understanding of the drivers of ‘health’ or resilience across complex socio-ecological systems (see below), and how we could develop better futures by learning from the past and proactively adapting in the present. 1.1.2 The Peel-Harvey Estuary The Peel-Harvey is the largest estuary in southern Western Australia (130 km2) and part of the Ramsar-listed Peel-Yalgorup wetland system (Brearley, 2005; Hale and Butcher, 2007). It’s large and shallow receiving basins (Peel Inlet and Harvey Estuary, mainly &lt; 2 m deep) are fed by three rivers (the Murray, Serpentine and Harvey) and are connected to the sea by two permanently-open channels (the natural Mandurah Channel and artificial Dawesville Cut; Fig. 1.2). The three main river subcatchments cover ~9,400 km2 across the coastal plain and adjoining Darling Scarp. Much of the sandy coastal plain has been developed for agriculture (dominated by beef cattle grazing), with some industrial activity (e.g. mines, refineries and intensive animal uses) and a fast-growing urban sector along the coastal fringe (Fig. 1.2). Most of the catchment on the escarpment drains into the Murray River and is dominated by native vegetation and, further inland, extensive cropping areas with some forestry plantations (Kelsey et al., 2011). The estuary is a key natural asset that is intrinsically tied to the cultural heritage of the broader Peel region, as well as the modern lifestyles and livelihoods of the people it supports. It also has a history of significant environmental decline linked to extreme nutrient enrichment and algal bloom issues (especially from the 1960s-1980s; McComb and Humphries, 1992), as well as a major remedial engineering intervention in the mid-1990s (the Dawesville Cut) to increase estuary flushing and help alleviate these problems (Bradby, 1997). Adding to this complex picture is the warming and drying climate across south-western Australia, especially since the 1970s (Silberstein et al., 2012), and the resulting impacts such as greatly reduced river flow, warmer temperatures and rising sea levels (Valesini et al., 2019a). Fortunately, longer-term data sets spanning the 1970s to recent decades exist for various elements of the system, including key meteorological and oceanographic drivers, river flow, river and estuarine water quality, seagrass, macroalgae and fish. Along-side the above-mentioned accelerating climate change pressures, the Peel is one of the fastest growing regions in Western Australia, with the population expected to more than triple to &gt;440,000 people by 2050 (Peel Development Commission, 2015). Various economic development and diversification strategies are also actively being pursued across the region (e.g. Transform Peel; Peel Development Commission, 2015; City of Mandurah and Shire of Murray, 2018). Given its particular history of fundamental ecosystem shifts through both chronic decline and an acute engineered ‘recovery’, as well as its current and forecast climate and development stressors, the Peel-Harvey represents an important opportunity to explore the resilience of estuarine systems and the societies they support. Our main study objectives are outlined below, with further detail on the objectives of each study component given in the underpinning catalogue of reports (see Tables 1 and 3 and section 4.1). 1.2 Project Objectives Develop indices of estuarine and societal health: Produce tangible, quantitative measures to assess ecosystem health status against established benchmarks. Establish historical trends and health status: Characterise or reconstruct the ‘past’ (1970s to ~2010), including decadal periods before and after the opening of the Dawesville Cut (1994), to establish how key elements of the Peel-Harvey environment, ecology and economy have changed over time1. Establish current trends and health status: Characterise the current (primarily 2016-20182) Peel-Harvey socio-ecological system through the collation of current data and collection of extensive new data. Build a comprehensive modelling and theoretical framework to power the Decision Support System: Construct a coupled catchment-estuary modelling framework, integrating past and current data, to (i) capture the complexity of ecosystem structure, function and processes across the catchment-estuarine continuum, (ii) enable prediction of estuarine health response under proposed future environmental or management conditions, and (iii) support a ‘systems view’ for integrating the effects of these futures on economic health. Explore current and future socio-ecological tradeoffs: Explore the current socio-ecological tradeoffs across the Peel-Harvey system, and compare them to those forecast under a set of future (2050) development, management and climate scenarios defined by Peel stakeholders. This study is among the first in Australia to integrate all of the above components to support sustainable development and understanding of whole-of-system resilience across a catchment Figure 1.2: (a) Peel-Harvey catchment and estuary, showing the three main river sub-catchments and broad land uses; (b) Peel-Harvey Estuary and detailed land uses on the coastal plain portion of the catchment (reproduced from Valesini et al. 2019a) 1.3 Approach 1.3.1 Concepts and components underlying the Decision Support System A conceptual diagram of the main study components and links comprising the DSS for exploring estuarine vs economic health tradeoffs is shown in Fig. 1.3. It is based loosely on the well-known ‘DPSIR’ model (Drivers, Pressures, State, Impact and Response), which provides a causal framework for describing the interactions between society and the environment (Atkins et al., 2011). The DPSIR model has been developed further over recent years (e.g. DAPSI[W]R[M]; Drivers, Activities, Pressures, State, Impacts [on human Welfare], Responses [as Measures]; Elliott et al., 2017), but the underlying logic remains similar. We have sought to integrate this approach with progress made from the development of a regional econometrics model of the Peel-Harvey system (Plummer et al. 2019) to develop an operational framework suited to decision support and scenario assessment. An overview of each main DSS component and its sub-components is given below, with further details provided in Table 1 and the accompanying catalogue of technical reports (see below). 1.3.2 Coupled catchment-estuary response model At the core of the DSS, is the coupled catchment-estuary response model framework which characterises the combined structure and function of the catchment and estuary, including the influence of external drivers such as climate and oceanography. This framework captures parts of the ‘Drivers’ and ‘Pressures’ elements of the DPSIR model. It comprises the catchment model; detailed tracing of nutrient ‘source to fate pathways’ using isotopic signatures; models of the estuary hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry (PHERM); other important components of the estuarine environment (Table 1). 1.3.3 Estuarine ecosystem resilience indicators A comprehensive suite of estuarine ecosystem health indicators form the second main component of the DSS, providing quantitative measures that span the environmental, ecological and ecosystem services spectrum. These indices capture various facets of the ‘State’ element of the DPSIR model. Many of these indices are linked either inherently or statistically to the coupled estuarine response model, enabling prediction of index response under proposed future scenarios (Fig. 1.3). While the calculations underlying these indices are complex, most are reported or illustrated simply on a ‘good-poor’ spectrum using either scales or ‘report card’ grades, so they can be easily interpreted by the wider community. The full suite of indicators are outlined in Table 1. 1.3.4 Regional economic resilience indicators The last main component of the DSS is a set of indicators that reflect the local competitiveness of Peel’s economy, and determine its resilience to external drivers (Table 1). These indicators summarise key metrics of the local economy such as competitive and comparative advantage, and more specific measures of industry specialisation and diversity, export potential, employment and rate of growth. These indices also capture various facets of the ‘State’ element of the DPSIR model. 1.3.5 Socio-ecological scenarios and tradeoffs Tradeoffs between the estuarine and economic resilience indices, or indeed those between different subsets of estuarine health indices, are then able to be assessed. Depending on the availability of different data sets (e.g. Table 2), these tradeoffs could be assessed under past conditions, current conditions, or proposed future conditions through scenario testing (Fig. 1.3). These tradeoffs capture the Impacts element of the DPSIR model. 1.3.6 Evidence-based decision-making framework The final element of the DPSIR model is the Response. This refers to the actions that managers and decision-makers across the Peel region may choose to take, given the information that is now available to them. This work delivers a framework to provide a transparent risk-management approach to support an ongoing and evidence-based adaptive decision making process. In this way, decisions related to either environmental management or catchment development share a common logic founded in resilience thinking principles, allowing agencies and groups charged with management to adopt a common road-map and project/policy assessment process. 1.3.7 Evidence-based decision-making framework The final element of the DPSIR model is the Response. This refers to the actions that managers and decision-makers across the Peel region may choose to take, given the information that is now available to them. This work delivers a framework to provide a transparent risk-management approach to support an ongoing and evidence-based adaptive decision making process. In this way, decisions related to either environmental management or catchment development share a common logic founded in resilience thinking principles, allowing agencies and groups charged with management to adopt a common road-map and project/policy assessment process.

Past and present data inform the ability of the DSS to predict future tradeoffs under stakeholder-defined scenarios, and hence inform management response. 1.3.8 Data collation, collection and repository Extensive historical data sets were collated to support development of the model and decision-support framework and individual components of the project, which are broadly summarised in Table 2. Additionally, extensive new field data were collected during this study to comprehensively summarise the current condition of the Peel-Harvey system. Broad categories of these new data sets are summarised in Figs 1.4 and 1.5 for the estuary and catchment, respectively. Figure 1.4: Summary of the sampling or monitoring sites in the Peel-Harvey Estuary at which environmental or biotic data were collected in 2016-2018 to support development of the DSS. Further detail on each of the field sampling regimes can be found in the respective reports (Table 1).

Further detail on each of the field sampling regimes can be found in the respective reports (Table 1). 1.4 Results &amp; Findings 1.4.1 Learning from the past and understanding the present The Cut and climate change have led to constant change in estuarine hydrology When the Cut was created it would have been difficult to anticipate the likely future trends in river flow. The results of our data compilation and hydrodynamic modelling showed us that the drying climate has fundamentally changed the hydrology by a comparable magnitude to that of the opening of the Cut, and also highlighted the complexity of their interacting effects. Firstly, the artificial channel successfully improved the estuary flushing by reducing average water ages by 20-110 days; while in contrast the reduced precipitation and catchment inflow had a gradual opposite effect on the water ages, and during the wet season this has almost counteracted the reduction brought about by the channel. Secondly, the drying climate caused an increase in the salinity of the lagoon by 10-30 psu; whilst the artificial channel increased the salinity during the wet season, it has reduced the likelihood of hypersalinity (&gt;40 psu) during the dry season in some areas. The impacts also varied spatially, with the southern estuary, which has the least connection with ocean through the natural channel, being identified the most sensitive to both climate change and the opening of the Cut. The relative rate of nutrient retention and balance of estuary metabolism has been responding since the Cut to changes in catchment inputs A reconstruction of nutrient loads over time, including the relative partitioning of the constituent nutrient species, has shown that there has been a long-term reduction in load, but relative stability in flow-weighted inflow concentrations. This suggests nutrient management has maintained nutrient levels at a constant level, and the overall load reduction is mostly a result of the drying trend reducing the nutrient-rich catchment flows. Within the estuary itself, continual changes in water quality have been occurring over time, not just following the Cut, but also a longer-term response following the recent period of reduced flows. The high-resolution Peel-Harvey Estuary Response Model (PHERM) has been able to capture variability across regions from rivers to lagoons and channels in water quality variability. The model has allowed the reconstruction of spatiotemporal variability in key water quality attributes and processes impacting the nutrient load partitioning within the estuary. Zonal budgets have identified local controls on carbon and nutrient metabolism, and were used to determine how estuary biogeochemical function responds to changes in flow and catchment loading. The pattern of nutrient retention and export has changed considerably over time, following the Cut in particular, but recent changes also due to the reduced inflows. Model simulations suggest the estuary has gradually shifted from being a net accumulator of nutrients to a net exporter. This is because the decrease in inflows means that internal loading can now exceed external inputs during low-flow years. Therefore, the amount of retention is dependent on annual flow, and will be sensitive to forecast projections of a drying climate. Ecologically, the estuary is showing signs of trouble Despite the notable reduction of nutrients in the main basins since the Cut, several lines of evidence from the faunal communities (bottom-dwelling invertebrates and fish) show that the current ecological health of the Peel-Harvey Estuary is often poor relative to established benchmark conditions (Hallett et al., 2019; Cronin-O’Reilly et al., 2019). The benchmarks for the fish fauna were established from a long-term historical data record (1978+), indicating that ecological health has generally declined over time. While the fish communities have become more marine, as expected following the opening of the Cut and the reduction in river flows, they are also often more sporadic in composition, less abundant, less speciose, and/or have fewer specialised feeding or habitat traits. Areas of the estuary with persistently poor fish faunal health were mainly linked with low dissolved oxygen conditions and bottom waters that had been retained in the estuary for long periods. The benthic invertebrates, whose benchmark conditions were established by sampling these fauna a large number of sites in 2016-18 (i.e. given the comparatively limited historical data across the full system), generally reflected a stressed community dominated by tolerant taxa. These invertebrate fauna were often in poor health, especially in summer, which was linked with high levels of organic matter and sulfidic muds, with low levels of oxygen in the sediment. One component of the estuarine ecology that has improved and is now often in good health compared to historical (1978+) conditions, is the submerged macrophyte (seagrass and macroalgae) community. These health changes mainly reflect the large reductions in green macroalgae and increases in seagrass since the opening of the Cut (Valesini et al., 2019b). However, there are also some parts of the estuary where these plant communities are in poor health, and are now in worse condition than at any time over the historical sampling record (see below). The deeper Murray River, southern Harvey Estuary and shallows of south-eastern Peel Inlet have emerged as ‘trouble hot-spots’, both environmentally and ecologically The above areas of the estuary are currently displaying consistent and/or increasing signs of stress based on their water quality, sediment quality and ecology. The Murray River was shown by the estuary response models to be experiencing more persistent salinity stratification, hypoxia and nutrient retention compared to historical periods (Huang et al. 2019), and the nutrient isotope/tracer data also highlighted that it receives relatively high groundwater inputs that contain very high nitrogen concentrations (Wells et al., 2019). The sediments in the Murray are also highly enriched with nutrients and organic matter (Hallett et al. 2019a), and the invertebrate and fish faunas in the deeper waters are in chronically-poor health (Cronin-O’Reilly et al. 2019; Hallett et al. 2019b). Similarly, the southern Harvey Estuary, which is poorly flushed by either tidal or riverine waters and so has long periods of water retention (~100-150 days in Summer and Autumn), also has highly enriched sediments and its deeper-water fish and invertebrate communities are in poor health. Furthermore, unlike most of the other basin regions where macrophyte health has improved over time, nuisance green macroalgae has been increasing in the southern Harvey Estuary in recent years, and is now the most abundant it has been over the 40 year sampling record. High nutrient enrichment, abundant green algal accumulations and poor benthic invertebrate health also characterised the shallow south-eastern Peel region. The community values healthy waterways as an important contributor to economic growth in the region The Peel-Harvey Region experienced overall increase in employment between 2006 and 2016 with an increasing workforce. The most significant period was between 2006 and 2011 with the region’s employment growth rate reaching 28.7%, followed by a period from 2011-2016 which grew at 18.8%. Based on analysis of economic data, the Peel Harvey region’s economy remained specialised in manufacturing, construction, agriculture, retail trade over this period. By 2016, mining surpassed agriculture in the degree of specialisation for the region. The majority of all other industries in Peel- Harvey also grew in size between 2006 and 2016. Links between economic growth and resilience, and the condition of the estuary system were conceptualised through a Socio-Ecological System (SES) systems model. This was used as a conceptual framework to highlight the link between essential ecosystem services and local attractiveness and competitiveness. The strong performance of construction and retail services reflects the drivers of urban expansion as residents seek the lifestyle benefits of the region. To reinforce the links between different sectors and the estuary health, the stakeholder values and aspirational goals for the region were sought through a structured solicitation process, incorporating perspectives ranging from a conservation focus to regional economic development. A synthesis of these views identified the most important value was high estuarine biodiversity and accompanying health, highlighting the estuary as an icon for residents, land-holders and businesses alike. Participants gave various responses that fell into this category, such as ‘good to excellent ecological health’; ‘biodiverse and/or resilient waterways’; ‘healthy wildlife’ (including fish, birds and/or dolphins); ‘healthy seagrass habitats’; ‘no/less major fish kills’ and ‘retaining Ramsar status’. Good water quality, underpinned by value and/or goal statements such as ‘no harmful algal blooms’, ‘TN/TP half of current levels’, ‘good dissolved oxygen levels’ ‘reduced contaminants’ was also ranked highly Socially, a Peel community that was environmentally-focused (e.g. ‘behaviour change towards environmentally sustainable practices’; ‘better community engagement/education in improving estuarine health’; ‘waterwise community’) and had good amenity to the estuary (e.g. ‘the estuary looks nice’; ‘good waterway recreation’; ‘good wildlife watching’) was highly valued, with supporting highly-ranked goal statements (e.g. ‘mandatory water sensitive urban design’; ‘mandatory nutrient testing programs’). From an economic perspective, better employment opportunities (e.g. ‘higher and/or more diverse employment’; ‘increased work skills’; ‘increased youth employment’) and sustaining key industries (e.g. ‘high growth/export industries’; ‘strong fishing/eco-tourism industries’) were also identified as being important to stakeholders. These results clearly highlight a community that supports sustainable development rather than “development at all costs”. 1.4.2 Preparing for a future Peel-Harvey The projected future drying climate is expected to have an overwhelming influence on water flows to the estuary, concentrating poor water quality and ecological problems in the rivers The drying climate projected for 2050 is forecast to continue to reduce water flows to the estuary (by ~50% compared to current conditions). Whilst this does have the benefit of reducing the overall nutrient load, it is likely to reduce flushing of nutrients in the sediment and allow incoming nutrients to persistent in the riverine reaches for longer. As these areas are likely to experience stronger and more persistent stratification, this trend is predicted to further exacerbate problems with hypoxia and harmful algal blooms in the rivers, and the associated frequency and extent of fish-kills. Implementing extensive catchment management actions can significantly reduce nutrient flows to the estuary. Large-scale implementation of catchment management actions (e.g. improving fertiliser management, applying soil amendments, riparian zone rehabilitation etc) under environmentally-sensitive development of the catchment was explored within the modelled scenarios, and is expected to significantly reduce nitrogen and especially phosphorous flows to the estuary compared to current conditions. As the joint pressures climate change and nutrient increases is detrimental to estuary condition, continued efforts towards nutrient reduction is also a potential strategy to help adapt to the drying climate. A portfolio of options to reduce to meet nutrient reduction targets has been identified, focused on on-farm and within-drain measures. Continuing with a ‘business as usual’ approach to catchment management will lead to further declines in estuarine heath. Comparison of scenarios with different levels of catchment management intervention (e.g. Fig 1.6) highlighted that doing nothing in the face of climate change, urban expansion and agricultural intensification will lead to declining water quality. Continuing with current rate of implementation of approaches to catchment management, as well as enabling agricultural and urban development as proposed in the Strategic Assessment of the Perth and Peel Regions, is forecast to intensify problems with hypoxia in the rivers and increase nutrient flows to the rivers and parts of the basins. On the other hand, alternate “green-growth” development strategies were shown to be able to make a positive impact on maintaining and potentially improving water quality. Additionally, through our link with the econometrics modelling, it was identified how investment in agricultural technology to improve production whilst reducing nutrient leaching good additionally drive local competitiveness and promote longer-term growth. Figure 1.6: Catchment land-use and drainage entering into the Peel-Harvey estuary model (PHERM; top) and example outputs of the model scenario comparison for a chosen estuary health indicator. See Hipsey et al. (2019b) for detail. 1.5 Recommendations for policy-makers Increase the scale and diversity of catchment and estuary management - the time for adaptation to growing stressors is now In general, future climate and development projections pose risks to estuary health that require substantial adaptive management in the present term. Doing nothing will lead to continued decline of the rivers and basins. No single solution or approach is possible and a multi-pronged adaptation strategy should be developed. Environmental water flows to maintain estuary health need to be considered and assessed as an option to help achieve the scale of ecosystem remediation required to adapt to expected future climate scenarios. Major reductions in nutrient delivery to the estuary can be achieved with concerted catchment management efforts (mainly improved fertiliser management, soil amendments, drain water management, revegetation and use of nutrient-stripping technology) and environmentally-sensitive development (i.e. through managing the extent and type of agricultural expansion). Such investment can produce positive estuarine health outcomes whilst improving the clean-green brand of WA agriculture. We identified this as strengthening the competitive advantage of the local economy and suggest further business cases should be developed to identify strategies such as nutrient offsets to encourage implementation and innovation. Large-scale nature-based restoration efforts within the estuary that can help support local fishery and ecotourism opportunities need to be explored. Monitor estuarine ecology and sediment to provide fuller insights into estuary health and the most effective management interventions Currently, there are no monitoring programs in the estuary for key aspects of its ecology (e.g. seagrass, fish) and/or supporting environmental elements except for water quality. Given the current state and trajectories of estuarine ecological health, and the value placed on it by the Peel community, it is crucial that these key ecosystem components are monitored consistently and regularly into the future. Monitoring regimes for the sediment, macrophytes, benthic invertebrates and fish have been proposed (see accompanying project reports), building on the extensive field work and validation undertaken in this Linkage Project. These regimes can be tailored to suit objectives and budget and, if adopted in the near future, can value-add to the current data sets. Consistent ecological data streams and calculation of accompanying health indices will also allow the real ecosystem impacts of any new management interventions to be understood, and support the ongoing refinement of the DSS framework. Continued efforts are required to curate and further develop the economic data for the region to allow for more rigorous assessment how the region is adapting to social and environmental change. Plan for development that can support economic growth, without increasing their water and nutrient footprint Whilst environmentally-sensitive land management and development priorities can come at a cost, our econometric analysis of the regional data suggests they can also encourage long-term economic resilience, as long as strategies are balanced to ensure export-oriented activities retain their competitiveness. For example, measures to foster technological innovation in agriculture, mining and tourism growth will serve to create new investment and export opportunities. Adaptive measures and policies to enhance regional investment in growing and under-developed industries associated with land management and ‘green-farming’ could be identified to encourage employment diversification within the region. Continue to develop the DSS to house and operationalise new data streams, and provide transparency in decision-making for sustainably developing the Peel region Fragmentation of decision-making across jurisdictions and geographic areas risks the estuary suffering “death by a thousand cuts”. A overarching body able to undertake a holistic assessment and build consensus on adaptation measures is needed to help drive restoration. The DSS produced in this Linkage Project integrates many disparate historical data sets, newly collected data and extensive modelling capacity into a single framework to enable risk-based assessment of developments proposed in the Peel region. It is a highly capable ‘toolbox’ which is able to be adapted to ask site-specific or regional question. It could be broadened to accommodate new components or data streams, or even tailored to specific detailed tasks. Beyond the catchment and estuary model tools, we have also developed a new conceptual framework for linking local and regional drivers, policies and management activities, with the multiple dimensions of estuary and economic health. The framework can be used as a transparent means for assessing new ideas and challenges on the health of the region. Through this framework, it is proposed the estuaries key ecosystem services are seen as critical assets and a risk-management approach is required to prevent their decline. This can be advanced through a collaborative governance model. The DSS is among the first of its kind in Australia, and so has chartered considerable new territory. As such, there are various aspects of the current framework that would benefit from further development and continued investment and improvement. This can be achieved through establishing ongoing partnerships with end-users to support the housing, servicing and interrogation of the DSS, as well as the regular integration of new environmental, ecological and economic data streams. Limited to those elements where sufficient historical data were available, including catchment and estuarine hydrology and water quality, macrophytes (seagrass and macroalgae), fish and regional economic competitiveness.↩︎ Some ecosystem elements included data from mid-late 2000s onwards to help establish ‘current’ conditions.↩︎ "],["modelling-of-the-peel-harvey-catchment.html", "2 Modelling of the Peel-Harvey Catchment 2.1 Abstract 2.2 Introduction 2.3 Approach 2.4 Results &amp; findings 2.5 Conclusions 2.6 Data availability &amp; supplementary materials 2.7 Acknowledgements", " 2 Modelling of the Peel-Harvey Catchment Karl Hennig, Kieryn Kilminster, Peta Kelsey, Ben Marillier, Joel Hall, Gayan Gunaratne, Malcolm Robb Department of Water and Environmental Regulation, Government of Western Australia, Perth, Australia. 2.1 Abstract The Source (eWater®) modelling platform was used to develop hydrological and nutrient models for the catchment of the Peel-Harvey Estuary. These models allow the nutrient export delivered to the estuary to be estimated and the major sources of these nutrients to be identified. This allows management actions to be targeted where they will have the most capacity to reduce nutrient export.  The model indicates that the nutrient load from all sub-catchments reaching the estuary is approximately 630 tonnes per year of nitrogen and 60 tonnes per year of phosphorus, averaged from 2006–2015. Additional nutrient loads also flow out to the ocean or are stored in dams. The major sources of nutrients by land-use are, for nitrogen, beef cattle farms (62% of total load), cropping (12%) and dairy cattle farms (6.8%) and, for phosphorus, beef cattle (67%), dairy cattle (8.1%) and horticulture (7.3%). The catchment model, which was coupled with an estuary response model in subsequent aspects of the research, was then used to compare a range of scenarios proposed for 2050 by stakeholders across the Peel region. These scenarios encapsulated three different catchment management narratives (termed ‘environmentally optimistic, ’business as usual’ and ‘environmentally pessimistic/economically optimistic’) under two climate regimes (current climate and 2050 predicted climate). Full details of the catchment model development, calibration and outputs of the tested scenarios relating to (i) land-use change, (ii) nutrient management and (iii) climate are outlined in separate documents detailed in the following report.  2.2 Introduction This study used catchment-scale models to estimate the water flows and loads and concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus to the Peel-Harvey Estuary and the ocean. The Source (eWater®) modelling platform was used to develop hydrological and nutrient models, which require meteorological and land-cover input data, and are calibrated using the data from flow and water quality monitoring sites located throughout the Peel-Harvey catchment. This modelling is an update of the work done by Kelsey et al. (2011), using different models and methodology. The Department of Water and Environmental Regulation (DWER) is currently preparing a detailed technical report on this revised catchment modelling, and exploring a suite of scenarios of land-use change, catchment management actions and climate change (Hennig et al., 2021). Specific catchment model outputs were made available to inform a set of three 2050 narratives or ‘plausible futures’ proposed by Peel stakeholders during project discussions and workshops. The scenarios underpinning these narratives, which are detailed in Hipsey et al. (2019), comprised specific land-use, catchment management and climate combinations. The catchment model outputs for each of these scenarios were then coupled with the estuary hydrodynamic and biogeochemical models developed in other parts of the research program (outlined in Chapters 3 and 4). This enabled forecasting of estuarine ecosystem response under each 2050 scenario (Chapter 11). Beyond this modelling analysis, the revised Peel-Harvey catchment model has been further applied to inform the development of the Peel-Harvey Estuary Protection Plan and a revision of the Peel Harvey Water Quality Improvement Plan, which are currently being developed by DWER. 2.2.1 Objectives Create a calibrated catchment hydrological model to estimate flow and nutrient loads in the Peel-Harvey. Run the model for a suite of 2050 scenarios related to catchment land-use, management and climate.  Analyse the catchment output data (flow, total nitrogen and total phosphorus) in the context of the linked Peel-Harvey estuary model to support forecasting of estuarine response under each 2050 scenario.  2.3 Approach 2.3.1 Model description Constructing a model for a particular catchment management situation involves selecting appropriate component models and linking them in the software (including rainfall-runoff models, nutrient export and filtering models, streamflow routing models etc.). We used the Source (eWater®) modelling platform which has been adopted widely around Australia for catchment modelling, and is at the core of the National Hydrological Modelling Platform program (Welsh et al., 2013). The model Source is based on the following building blocks: Catchments: The sub-catchment is the basic spatial unit, which is then divided into hydrological response units (or functional units) based on a common response or behaviour such as land-use. Nodes: Nodes represent sub-catchment outlets, stream confluences or other places of interest such as stream gauges or dam walls. Nodes are connected by links, forming a representation of the stream network.  Links: Links represent the river reaches. Within each link, a selection of models can be applied to route or delay the movement of water along the link or modify the contaminant loads due to processes occurring within the links, such as the decay of a particular constituent over time. The basis of the hydrological model comprised three different models for land-uses classified as urban, cleared and vegetated, and their combined flow describes the total flow (Fig. 2.1). Each of the 23 descriptive land-use classes identified across the Peel-Harvey catchment (Fig. 2.2) were assigned to the broader urban, vegetated or cleared categories. The hydrological model was calibrated predominantly using gauged station data from 2000–2015. Urban: Urban land-uses (such as urban residential, commercial and education offices, industry, manufacturing and transport) were assigned the calibrated parameters for Bannister Creek, as this was the gauge with the best calibration metrics.  Vegetated: Vegetated land-uses (such as plantations, rural living bush block, native vegetation) were calibrated to vegetated gauged catchments. Model parameters were assigned by major river (Serpentine and Murray).  Cleared: Cleared land-uses (such as dairy, beef, cropping, horticulture) were calibrated to flow gauging stations throughout the Peel-Harvey catchment.  Figure 2.1: Components of the hydrological model at the modelling catchment scale. Cleared, urban and vegetated land-uses have unique hydrological models. The flow generated from these land-uses amount to the total flow generated by a modelling catchment, as indicated by the blue ‘total’ graph. The nutrient model framework in Source has four modules: Constituent generation models: which determine how constituents (e.g. sediments or nutrients) are generated within a functional unit (e.g. a land-use parcel within a sub-catchment) and the resulting concentrations or loads that are passed to the filter model.  Inflow nodes: Inflow nodes have been used to include point sources of nutrients, septic tanks, dam inflows and irrigation returns. The nutrients from these sources are external to the constituent generation and filtering models. Filtering models: which represent any transformation of constituents between generation within the functional unit and arrival at the sub-catchment node. Filtering models process constituents within the functional units. Filtering models have been used to represent nutrient processes in vegetated riparian zones. In-stream processing models: This model has not been included explicitly in-stream processing models. Instead, these processes are implicit within the catchment calibration process. The diffuse nutrient model uses the power function (flow in mm) constituent generation model to generate total nitrogen and total phosphorus concentrations. The modelling functional units include the 23 land-use categories and two soil phosphorus retention index (PRI) categories (to represent poor soils that are prevalent on the Swan Coastal Plain). Calibration was undertaken for all catchments upstream of water quality monitoring sites and was used for both nitrogen and phosphorus. The nutrient model was calibrated to winter nutrient concentration data for the period of 2011–2015. Dairy farms were modelled using the same approach described for the diffuse nutrient model. However, farm nutrient surplus was modified using a farm nutrient budget that considered nutrients from paddock and dairy shed effluent.  Water and nutrients from dam releases and irrigation returns were calculated separately and included as inflow nodes.  Riparian zone nutrient removal was calculated linearly, assuming 0% removal for catchments with 0% riparian zone vegetation to the maximum nutrient removal for catchments with 100% riparian zone vegetation. Stream order was also considered. It was assumed that first- and second-order streams required half the vegetated riparian zone width of larger-order streams to achieve the same percentage nutrient reductions (Hennig and Kelsey, 2015). The vegetated riparian zone nutrient-removal percentages were assumed to be the same as the ‘medium’ quality riparian zone efficacy given in the Leschenault Estuary Water Quality Improvement Plan (Hugues-dit-Ciles et al., 2012). The nutrient removal of riparian zones on the Swan Coastal Plain was assumed to be less effective that those in inland areas (Hugues-dit-Ciles et al., 2012). 2.3.2 Model input data Meteorological data was derived from the Australian Water Availability Project (AWAP) which provides daily gridded rainfall, temperature, vapour pressure and solar exposure data. Daily rainfall and calculated potential evapotranspiration (PET) data were extracted for the centroids of the modelling catchments for 1/1/1960 to 31/12/2015. PET was calculated using the FAO56 methodology (Allen et al., 1998; Ladson and Weinmann, 2008), with missing data infilled as following: Solar exposure data was not available pre-1990. Global exposure data was substituted prior to 1990.  Vapour pressure was not available prior to 1971 and was infilled using average monthly vapour pressure from 1971-2015. The catchment model climate data series was later updated with SILO data from 1/1/2016 to 8/10/2018 to generate data for the estuary model. At the time, AWAP data could not be generated. More information about SILO data can be found here. The land-use mapping dataset from Kelsey et al. (2011) was updated to represent land-use present in 2015, and was informed by the state cadastre dataset (Landgate), aerial photography, upper storey vegetation calculated from LIDAR (DWER) and native vegetation data (Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development) (Fig. 2). The land-use mapping update focused on the inclusion of new urban developments, large-scale changes to agricultural land-uses and practices, intensive agriculture and riparian zone revegetation. Nutrients associated with land-use (e.g. input, surplus rates and nutrient use efficiencies) were assigned with data sourced from relevant literature and assumptions. Nutrient surplus is equal to nutrient input minus nutrient output. Nutrient surpluses can be stored (e.g. in livestock, soil or plant matter) or lost from the land parcel. Nutrient losses can occur though leaching to groundwater, via surface runoff, or to the atmosphere (e.g. wind erosion, fire, denitrification, volatilisation). Nutrient use efficiency (NUE) is nutrient out divided by nutrient in, expressed as a percentage. Land-uses with 100% NUE convert all nutrient inputs to nutrient outputs and therefore have a nutrient surplus of zero. Fig. 2.3 shows land-uses ranked by nutrient surplus and nutrient use efficiency.  Other input data included soil phosphorus retention, environmental water provision/releases, irrigation returns, point sources (e.g. feedlots, stockyards, piggeries, abattoirs, poultry, industrial and waste water treatment plant) and septic tanks (more than 12,000 in the Peel-Harvey Estuary catchments). Fig. 2.4 displays the full extent of the Peel-Harvey catchment, including its main drainage features and reporting catchment boundaries.  2.3.3 Model calibration Full details of model calibration, parameterisation and model performance will be provided in Hennig et al. (XXXX).  Where possible, the hydrological models were calibrated for the 2000–2015 period and validated using data from 1980–1999. This was done so that the hydrological model produced accurate results for the period for which most results were derived (2006–2015) and because the 2000–2015 period had substantially lower flow. As a result, the model consistently underestimated larger flow events that were present in the validation period of 1980–1999. The nutrient models were calibrated using data recorded at water quality monitoring sites across the catchment. Five-year winter median nutrient concentrations (2011–2015) were used as the primary calibration statistic, with a difference of ±15% deemed acceptable and a difference of ±5% set as the calibration objective. All sites had modelled median winter nutrient concentrations within 5% of observed winter median concentrations (Fig. 2.5). Figure 2.2: Land-use classes for the Peel-Harvey catchment. Figure 2.3: Nitrogen (top) and phosphorus (bottom) surplus and nutrient use efficiency (NUE), ranked by land-use. Figure 2.4: Reporting catchments for the Peel-Harvey. Figure 2.5: Winter median observed and modelled total nitrogen (top) and total phosphorus (bottom) concentrations. All sites represent the 2011–2015 period except 614037, which represents 1995–2000. The locations of these sites are given in Fig. 6. 2.3.4 Coupling to the estuary model This model was used to provide inputs of water flow, total nitrogen and total phosphorus to the estuary hydrological and biogeochemical models, reported in Chapters 3 and 4. The locations of catchment inputs to the estuary model are shown Fig. 2.6. For the catchment model outputs prior to 2000, an adjustment was needed to correct for an underestimation of the flow by the model in this period. This underestimation was likely due to the catchment model being calibrated during a dry period from 2000–2015 (see section ??4.3??). This bias correction was only applied to model outputs used for the estuary model inputs prior to 2000. Details of how this bias was adjusted are given in Supplementary Materials S2.1.  2.3.5 Scenarios This calibrated catchment nutrient model was used to explore a range of scenarios relating to (i) land-use change, (ii) nutrient management and (iii) climate. Specifically for this research study, a set of eight scenarios were run using this model that aligned with the three 2050 narratives identified by Peel stakeholders [‘environmentally optimistic,’business as usual’ and ‘environmentally pessimistic/economically optimistic’], i.e. two scenarios for each narrative and two further scenarios to represent the ‘base case’ or current conditions. A summary of the model configurations underpinning each scenario is given in Chapter 11, and a detailed account of the fuller range of scenarios is also given in Hennig et al. (XXXX).  Figure 2.6: Catchment model inputs to the estuary model (white circles) and catchment monitoring sites (circle with site number). 2.4 Results &amp; findings 2.4.1 Flows and loads to the Peel-Harvey Estuary Average annual loads (2006–2015) of nutrients estimated to be exported from the Peel-Harvey catchment were lower than the previous reporting period, mainly due to reduced river flow The nutrient load from all catchments is approximately 830 tonnes per year of nitrogen and 90 tonnes per year of phosphorus. The loads to the Peel-Harvey Estuary were estimated to be 630 tonnes of nitrogen and 60 tonnes of phosphorus (with the remainder flowing out to the ocean or stored in dams).  Estimated flows and nutrient loads were substantially lower than estimated in previous modelling by Kelsey et al. (2011), which gave results for the period of 1997–2007. During the current modelling period of 2006–15, the climate was drier and thus resulted in less river flow and nutrient loading to the Peel-Harvey Estuary. However, concentrations of nutrients from the current model remain excessive. All estuary catchments on the coastal plain had flow-weighted concentrations in excess of ANZECC guidelines (2000) for lowland rivers (1.2 mg/L TN and 0.065 TP). A detailed discussion about water quality targets will be given in a detailed technical report that is currently being prepared by the DWER. Most nutrients are delivered to the estuary in winter Actual nutrient loads in a given year have a fairly tight relationship to flow, as shown in Fig. 2.7. More than 90% of the flow and nutrient is discharged during the winter months (June-October). 2.4.2 Source of nutrients Of the 13 catchments modelled, three catchments (Harvey, Lower Murray and Upper Serpentine) contribute 60% of the total nitrogen and phosphorus load to the estuary Overall, the catchments that delivered the greatest loads of nutrients to the Peel-Harvey estuary were: Nitrogen:  Harvey (205 tonnes, 32%) Lower Murray (103 tonnes, 16%) Upper Murray (80 tonnes, 13%) Upper Serpentine (72 tonnes, 11%). Phosphorus: Harvey (20 tonnes, 33%) Upper Serpentine (10 tonnes, 17%)  Nambeelup (6.7 tonnes, 11%)  Lower Murray (6.2 tonnes, 10%). The nutrient loads per cleared area of estuary catchments (excluding the Upper Murray) are 3.6 kg/ha/yr of nitrogen and 0.39 kg/ha/yr of phosphorus. The catchments with the greatest average annual nutrient loads that drain to the estuary are, for nitrogen: (1) Harvey (6.1 kg/cleared ha); (2) Dirk Brook (4.1 kg/cleared ha); (3) Nambeelup (3.7 kg/cleared ha) and, for phosphorus: (1) Nambeelup (0.61 kg/cleared ha); (2) Harvey (0.59 kg/cleared ha); (3) Lower Serpentine (0.42 kg/cleared ha). The major sources of nutrients by land-use are, for nitrogen: beef (62% of total load), cropping (12%) and dairy (6.8%) and, for phosphorus: beef (67%), dairy (8.1%) and horticulture (7.3%) The above land-uses above account for approximately 80% of the nitrogen and phosphorus loads delivered to the Peel-Harvey Estuary. Beef is clearly the largest source of nutrients in the Peel-Harvey catchment. This is primarily due to the large area of beef farming (Fig. 2.2), its high nutrient surplus rate, poor nutrient-use efficiency (&lt;10%) and its location on the Swan Coastal Plain (high rainfall and large areas of low PRI soils). Intensive animal uses (piggeries, abattoirs, poultry, feedlots and stockyards) contribute &lt;5% of the total nutrient load. While this could be considered small at an estuary catchment scale, the nutrient load is much greater at a reporting catchment scale. For instance, 17% of the phosphorus load of the Meredith catchment is estimated to originate from piggeries. Point sources (e.g. wastewater treatment plans, industrial sources, composting facilities) contribute &lt;1% of the nutrient load. However, septic tank nutrient contributions are much larger, accounting for 3.1% and 2.6% of the nitrogen and phosphorus loads, respectively, reaching the estuary. Figure 2.7: Annual flow and nitrogen and phosphorus loads from the major river catchments to the Peel-Harvey Estuary. 2.5 Conclusions The calibrated catchment model estimates that, on average, 630 tonnes of nitrogen and 60 tonnes of phosphorus reaches the Peel-Harvey Estuary per year – with disproportionately greater loads coming from a few catchments The catchments that contribute the greatest average annual nutrient loads per cleared area are, for nitrogen: Harvey (6.1 kg/cleared ha), Dirk Brook (4.1 kg/cleared ha), Nambeelup (3.7 kg/cleared ha), and for phosphorus:  Nambeelup (0.61 kg/cleared ha), Harvey (0.59 kg/cleared ha), Lower Serpentine (0.42 kg/cleared ha), Beef cattle farming was the land-use responsible for the majority of both nitrogen and phosphorus exported to the estuary The major sources of nutrients by land-use are, for nitrogen: beef (62% of total load), cropping (12%) and dairy (6.8%) and, for phosphorus: beef (67%), dairy (8.1%) and horticulture (7.3%). 2.6 Data availability &amp; supplementary materials Data used for the model and supporting the conclusions of this study are available in the Peel ARC Linkage Project Github repository (Busch et al., 2023).

The drying climate trend in the south-west Australian region has been widely reported, though the interaction of the trend in river flow and changes to estuarine hydrodynamics brought about by the Dawesville Cut on estuarine conditions has been complex, and it is necessary to establish implications of these changes for future management of the estuary. This study developed a 3D finite-volume hydrodynamic model to assess changes in estuary hydrodynamics, considering how attributes such as water retention time, salinity and stratification have responded to the drying climate trend the artificial channel over the period from 1970 to 2016, and how they will evolve under current climate projections. Our results show that both have significantly changed the hydrology by comparable magnitudes, and also highlight the complexity of their interacting impacts. Firstly, the artificial channel successfully improved estuary flushing by reducing average water ages by 20–110 days, whilst in contrast the reduced inflow from the catchment (more than 50% since 1970) has had the gradual opposite effect on the water ages, and during the wet season this has almost counteracted the reduction brought about by the channel. Secondly, the drying climate has caused an increase in the salinity by 10–30 psu; whilst the artificial channel increased the salinity during the wet season, it has reduced the likelihood of hypersalinity (&gt;40 psu) during the dry season in the western areas. The impacts also varied spatially. The southern estuary, which has limited connection with ocean through the natural channel, is shown to be the most sensitive to climate change and the opening of the artificial channel. The projected future drying climate is shown to slightly increase the retention time and salinity in the lagoon, and increase the hypersalinity risk in the rivers. The significance of these changes for nutrient retention and estuary ecology are discussed, highlighting the importance of these factors when setting up monitoring programs, environmental flow strategies and nutrient load reduction targets. 3.2 Introduction (Almroth-Rosell et al., 2016) EXAMPLE Hydrologic features such as water circulation, retention and the pattern of saline water intrusion are critical in shaping estuarine ecosystems and health. The interactions of pulses of freshwater runoff with ocean water inputs can create complex hydrodynamics that subsequently structures the biogeochemical processes, including the distribution of nutrients and hotspots of primary productivity (e.g. Legović et al., 1994; Kasai et al., 2010; Watanabe et al., 2014; Cloern et al., 2017). In particular, salt intrusion can increase lagoon salinity and drive a difference between surface and bottom salinity (salinity stratification). In highly seasonal systems, like in southern Australia, this effect leads to notable oxygen depletion and establishes hypoxia in the bottom boundary layer (Bruce et al., 2014; Cottingham et al., 2014; Huang et al., 2018), and can raise the likelihood of hypersalinity during the long dry summer and autumn months (Potter et al., 2010). More generally, the time-scales associated with water transportation and retention are often related to the long-term trophic state and ensuing phytoplankton dynamics in coastal systems (e.g. Knoppers et al., 1991; Ferreira et al., 2005; Paerl et al., 2006; Zhu et al., 2017). Therefore, understanding and predicting hydrologic changes is critical to underpin our understanding of estuary water quality and approaches to management. In systems undergoing hydrologic change, it remains an ongoing challenge to attribute changes in river flows, meteorological and ocean conditions to changes in estuary function, also bearing in mind coastal engineering developments. The impacts of climate change on estuarine hydrology have been widely reported and shown to significantly affect the water quantity and quality of many estuaries (e.g. Ducharne et al., 2007; Whitehead et al., 2009; Liu and Chan, 2016). One of these effects is the reduction of precipitation, which subsequently leads to reduction of streamflow to estuaries (Graham, 2004; Silberstein et al., 2012; Smith and Power, 2014) and increases the water retention time (τ). Aside from climate change, the hydrodynamics of an estuary is also often modified by engineering projects associated with dredging and coastal management, or through the creation of artificial channels built to enhance hydrologic connectivity to the ocean, and increase nutrient export (Brearley, 2005; Manda et al., 2014; Prestrelo and Monteiro-Neto, 2016). However, the combined effects of introducing an artificial channel in conjunction with the climate change trend is not necessarily easy to predict. For example, the opening of an artificial channel and a drying climate can both introduce more ocean intrusion into an estuary. On the other hand, the drying climate enhances water residence time, which may cancel out the effect of the artificial channel. The combined effects are further complicated in large lagoon-type estuaries with complex morphology. The Peel-Harvey Estuary (PHE) is one such system experiencing both a severe drying climate and the opening of large artificial channel to enhance ocean flushing and nutrient export. The impact on water resources of recent climate trends has been particularly acute in the PHE catchment, and the IPCC AR4 identified this region as one that has experienced amongst the greatest impact on divertible water resources in the world ( Hennessy et al., 2007; Bates et al., 2008). From the 1970s, rainfall has decreased by 16% and stream flows have declined by more than 50%, a trend which has appeared to accelerate since the 2000s (Silberstein et al., 2012). The “Dawesville Cut” (hereafter referred as “the Cut”), was built in 1994 with the purpose of increasing the flushing of the lagoons and thus reducing nutrient levels. Observations have shown that the water nutrient and phytoplankton concentrations have been successfully reduced by the construction of the channel (Brearley, 2005), yet long-term river gauged data have shown a clear trend of decreasing runoff to the estuary, which has caused concerns to the catchment and estuary managers. A series of water quality improvement plans (Environmental Protection Authority, 2008; Rogers et al., 2010; Kelsey et al., 2011) have been set to achieve a healthier aquatic system, which requires knowledge of how the hydrology changes with time in this estuary. 3.2.1 Objectives This report aims to understand how the hydrology of this shallow, choked estuary is influenced by the drying climate and the Cut opening, separately and jointly, over decadal time periods. This is achieved using a 3D hydrodynamic model, with the main objectives to: Investigate the general trends of key hydrologic features (water age, τ, and salinity) corresponding to the drying climate; Assess the interacting impacts of the artificial channel with climate change on τ and salinity; Consider the implications of these hydrologic changes to estuarine ecosystem management. 3.3 Approach 3.3.1 Development of a high-resolution hydrodynamic model The TUFLOW-FV (BMT WBM, 2013) package was used for this investigation as a 3D flexible-mesh (finite volume) hydrodynamic model that accounts for variations in water level, horizontal salinity distribution and vertical density stratification in response to tides, inflows and surface thermodynamics. The mesh consists of triangular and quadrilateral elements of different size that are suited to simulating areas of complex estuarine morphometry. To meet accuracy requirements, a fine-grid resolution (mean mesh area ~12000 m2) was used within the lagoons and coarse resolution was implemented towards the ocean boundary. The vertical mesh discretization adopted a hybrid sigma-z coordinate allowing multiple surface Lagrangian layers to respond to tidal elevation changes. The layer thickness was 0.2 m at depths of 1.0–5.0 m that gradually increased to 0.5 m in deeper water, and then five uniformly-distributed sigma layers were added above the fixed-thickness layers. The finite volume numerical scheme solves the conservative integral form of the nonlinear shallow water equations in addition to the advection and transport of scalar constituents such as salinity and temperature. The equations are solved in 3D with baroclinic coupling from both salinity and temperature using the UNESCO equation of state (Fofonoff and Millard, 1983). The model computes water transportation time-scales using the concept of water age, which is defined as the time the water has spent since entering the estuary through boundaries (either the ocean or river). The water age in each computational cell, \\(\\tau\\), was computed as a conservative tracer subject to a constant increase with time (i.e. \\(d\\tau⁄dt=1\\)). Surface momentum exchange and heat dynamics are solved internally within TUFLOW- FV. In the current application, turbulent mixing of momentum and scalars has been calculated using the Smagorinsky scheme in the horizontal plane and through coupling with the General Ocean Turbulence Model (GOTM) for vertical mixing with option of second-order \\(k-\\varepsilon\\) turbulence closure. The bottom shear stress was calculated using a roughness-length relationship assuming a rough-turbulent logarithmic velocity profile in the lowest model layer. The roughness length z0 settings were based on the area type (e.g. coast, rivers, and estuary) and the estimated biomass of aquatic vegetation within the estuary. For the purpose the modelling domain was categorized into eight zones (Fig. 3.1b) where the benthic character and associated \\(z_0\\) in each zone are specified. While the setting of \\(z_0\\) affected the water advection and uncertainty remains in the spatial (and temporal) variability in the \\(z_0\\), it is important to note that the modelled \\(\\tau\\) and salinity do not change fundamentally over a reasonable range of \\(_z0\\), as shown in the results of the model sensitivity tests described later. Figure 3.1: Model domain of the Peel-Harvey Estuary and three main rivers: Serpentine River, Murray River, and Harvey River.

The average annual precipitation dropped by 15% in 1994-2016 compared to the period 1970-1993, and this led to a dramatic decrease of annual inflow volumes, especially in the recent decade. For example, the 10-year moving average of the Murray River inflow rate dropped from 340 GL in 1970 to 98 GL in 2016, and similar declines are seen in the other rivers (not shown). Years with inflow rates close to the 10-year moving average were selected for hydrologic modelling simulations to explore in more detail the hydrologic changes in these years (depicted relative to the trend in Fig. 3.2b). Due to the concern that the drying climate will continue into 21st century (Silberstein et al., 2012), we also undertook model simulations to investigate the potential hydrologic changes in “future scenarios” representative of 2040 and 2060, by considering reduced streamflow and rising sea levels. The runoff declines were based on the mean projection by Smith and Power (2014) that suggested the total runoff to the rivers and estuaries within the WA region will drop by about 0.96% per year, corresponding to the projected reduction in precipitation of 0.27% per year, on average. Sea level rise was also included in the future scenarios, estimated from the long- term (1897–2000) tide gauge observations at the Fremantle tide gauge station that shows a sea level trend of 1.50 mm/yr (Kuhn et al., 2011). These estimates may be biased due to a possible accelerated sea level rise towards the end of the 21st century (IPCC, 2007; Kuhn et al., 2011). Figure 3.2: Historical record of (a) annual precipitation rate; (b) Murray River annual inflow rate; (c) monthly-average sea level at Fremantle gauge station; (d) salinity at Harvey Estuary and Peel Inlet; and (e) total chlorophyll-a (TCHLA) in Harvey Estuary and Peel Inlet since 1970 to 2016. For the modelling years after 1994, when the artificial channel was constructed, we also ran “no-Cut scenarios” that assumed the Dawesville Cut was not constructed, in order to separate the impact of the artificial engineering intervention on hydrology relative to the “with-Cut” scenarios. Where gauged data wasn’t available, the outputs of the catchment model were used. Weather conditions over the period were set based on a combination of weather station data and model outputs from the regional WRF model. A summary of all historical simulations and future scenarios is provided in Table 1. The total inflow into the estuary of the chosen simulation years shows a general decrease from past to future, except for the year 1978 when the total inflow rate was less than that in 1985 and 1990. This was due to an exceptionally low inflow rate at the Harvey River, produced from the catchment model output, which had an effect mostly on the Harvey Estuary. We still include this year to show the historical evolution during the past decades. 3.3.3 Model evaulation and sensitivity tests The model accuracy in reproducing the key hydrologic features was assessed by using the salinity and temperature data measured at six monitoring stations along the estuary (Fig. 3.1). For each variable, we evaluated the model quantitatively against the monitored data using three skill metrics: correlation coefficient (r), mean absolute error (MAE), and model skill score (SS). Comprehensive evaluation was conducted for all the simulation years, except for 1970 when the long term monitoring had not started yet. The evaluation focused on the salinity and water temperature at the surface and bottom water of 6 monitoring stations along the estuary. Surface elevation records obtained from two gauged stations in the centre of Peel Inlet and Harvey Estuary were also used, when they were available, to validate the modelled surface elevation. The current study focused on the impact of reduced inflow, due to drying climate and the Cut, on the estuary hydrology. However, the perturbations of environmental factors such as air temperature, tide elevation, and benthic vegetation could also affect the local hydrology, therefore their influence to the modelling results was explored. To do this, the sensitivity of the modelled τ and salinity to the changes of: (1) air temperature (±1 degree, representing 100 year change of local air temperature); (2) tidal elevation (±0.15m, representing 100 year change of local tide record); and (3) bed roughness length (±50%, representing 50% change of bed roughness). The ranges of these environmental factors were carefully selected based on the historical records. Two years, 1998 and 1990, representing a year with the Cut opening and another year without the Cut, respectively, were selected for the model sensitivity tests. 3.4 Main Findings 3.4.1 Model reconstruction of historical conditions The monitored and modelled salinity and temperature within the two lagoons in the year of 1990 (a ‘pre-Cut’ year, the year before the Cut constructed) and year of 1998 (a ‘post-Cut year’, the year after the Cut constructed) demonstrate the ability of the model to accurately capture the seasonal cycle in response to the catchment inflows (Fig. 3.3). In summer and early autumn the flow rates were low, followed by high salinity and weak salinity stratification in the two lagoons. In contrast, there were large inflows to the estuary in winter and early spring. The peaks of the inflows occurred in winter (July–September), followed by a significant drop in the salinity in the estuary due to the freshwater flushing. However, differences in the salinity response to freshwater flushing can be observed between the pre-Cut year (1990, left column of Fig. 3.3) and the post-Cut year (1998, right column of Fig. 3.3). In 1990 when the estuary had limited connection without the opening of the Cut, the salinity stratification was small in the Harvey Estuary. The salinity dropped to below 5 psu, indicating the hydrology of Harvey Estuary was mainly dominated by the Harvey River flushing. Whilst during 1998, with greater ocean connection due to the opening of the Cut, stronger salinity stratification was observed in the Harvey Estuary, and the minimum salinity was lifted to over 10 psu due to more seawater intrusion from the Cut. The water temperature also presented a clear seasonal signal, ranging from about 10 °C in winters to 30 °C in summers. The differences in the water temperature observed in the centres of two lagoons, and between the surface and bottom waters, were small. The opening of the Cut also affected the surface elevations of the estuary (Fig. 3.4). The tide elevations in the ocean showed similar characteristics in 1990 and 1998 in terms of the annual mean sea level (−0.079 m and −0.027 m in 1990 and 1998, respectively) and tidal range (both &lt; 1m). However, the surface elevation measured at the centre of the estuary had significantly different characteristics in these two years. The estuary surface elevation in 1998 had a much wider range of −0.6 m to 0.8 m compared to that in 1990 of −0.4 m to 0.4 m, indicating higher magnitude of water exchange between the estuary and the ocean due to the opening of the Cut. In general, the model reproduced the temporal variations of salinity and temperature in both the surface and water well (Table 2). The mean regression coefficient r for the salinity from six monitoring sites is above 0.81, and for the water temperature is above 0.85 except in the year 1970, when a mean r of 0.72 was obtained, which may have been due to poor boundary forcing for this year. The model skill scores are generally higher than 0.61 for both salinity and temperature in all historical years, suggesting the model has captured the major features of the hydrologic response to the external forcing of tide and freshwater inputs. Figure 3.3: Annual variation in 1990 (left column, a) and 1998 (right column, b) of (1) inflow rate of the three main rivers; (2) monitored and modelled surface and bottom salinity at the centre of Peel Inlet (site PH7 at Fig. 1); (3) monitored and modelled surface and bottom water temperature at the centre of Peel Inlet; (4) monitored and modelled surface and bottom salinity at the centre of Harvey Estuary (site PH1 at Fig. 1); (3) monitored and modelled surface and bottom water temperature at the centre of Harvey Estuary. Figure 3.4: (a) Sea level variation in 1990 and 1998; (b) modelled vs. measured surface elevation in the centre of Peel Inlet in 1990 (r=0.9795), the grey line indicates the 1:1 ratio; and (c) same as figure b except for year 1998 (r=0.9841). The colour from blue to red in figure b and c indicate the data density from minimum to maximum. The sensitivities of modelled salinity and \\(\\tau\\) to air temperature, tide elevation, and bed roughness are shown in Fig. 3.5. The changes in the air temperature of ±1 degree have minor effects on both the salinity and \\(\\tau\\) in both years of 1990 and 1998. The influence of air temperature on the hydrology was mostly through evaporation, and resulted in changes in salinity of less than 0.9 psu, and 0.5 days changes in \\(\\tau\\). Secondly, the changes in the mean tide elevation of ±0.15 m led to changes in salinity of up to 2.2 psu and 8.4 days in \\(\\tau\\). This is not surprising because the changes in the mean tide elevation were theoretically equal to changing the volume of this shallow estuary, where 0.15 m is significant when compared to the mean estuary depth of ~1.4 m. Thirdly, the bed friction also had a noteworthy impact on the salinity and \\(\\tau\\) by modifying the water movement and therefore benthic layer mixing at near-bed level. The presence of benthic vegetation was shown to impact salinity by up to 2.8 psu in the Harvey Estuary, while a maximum change in the \\(\\tau\\) of 8.6 days was observed in the same location. Figure 3.5: Sensitivity of the modelled annual-mean salinity and retention time in the Peel Inlet and Harvey Estuary. SV: standard scenario; S1: +1 degree in air temperature scenario; S2: −1 degree in air temperature scenario; S3: +0.15 m in tide elevations scenario; S4: −0.15 m in tide elevations scenario; S5: +50% in bed roughness scenario; S6: −50% in bed roughness scenario. In summary, the modelled salinity and \\(\\tau\\) were more sensitive to the changes in the sea level variation and bottom vegetation presence, but the effects of these environmental factors were still small when compared to that caused by the reduced flow over the past decade and the Cut opening. For example, the maximum change in \\(\\tau\\) observed in the sensitivity test runs was 8.6 days, caused by the enhanced bottom roughness in the 1990 scenario, compared to the magnitude of 20–100 days caused by the reduced flow from 1970 to 2016 (see more details below). The maximum changes in the salinity observed in the sensitivity test runs was 2.8 psu, caused by the reduction of tide level in the Harvey Estuary, compared to the magnitude of 10–30 psu changes in the salinity caused by the reduced flows from 1970 to 2016 (see more details below). 3.4.2 Incomplete mixing and changes in water rentention times Water retention time in tidal lagoons is sometimes confusing because various definitions that are used (flushing time, water age, and residence time) (e.g. Monsen et al., 2002; Jouon et al., 2006). The flushing time is the most popular concept and has been used in many aquatic systems, including the PHE, in the early 90s (Lord, 1998) as it is convenient as an indicator of water transportation relative to the time scales of nutrient inputs or biogeochemical processes. The flushing time is “a bulk or integrative parameter that describes the general exchange characteristics of a waterbody without identifying the underlying physical processes, the relative importance of those processes, or their spatial distribution” (Monsen et al., 2002), which can be numerically represented as (Sheldon and Alber, 2006): \\[ \\begin{equation} \\tau_{f} = \\frac{V}{Q_{FW}+R_{O}+Q_{SW}} \\end{equation} \\] where \\(\\tau_{f}\\) is the bulk flushing time of the estuary, \\(V\\) is the estuary volume (=187.5 GL), 𝑄𝐹𝑊 is the freshwater inflow rate, \\(Q_{SW}\\) is the average seawater flow rate over a tidal period, and \\(R_{O}\\) is the exchange fraction of the seawater fluxes that contribute to flushing (Rynne et al., 2016). The values of \\(Q_{SW}\\) and \\(Q_{SW}\\) are derived from model outputs, while the value of \\(R_{O}\\) is set to 0.27 following the study of Taylor and Dean (1974) in a lagoon-type estuary. Both the mean \\(\\tau\\) from the hydrodynamic model and the \\(\\tau_{f}\\) bulk approximation show significant reduction of retention time in summertime and wintertime due to the Cut opening (Fig. 3.6). Yet the \\(\\tau_{f}\\) is about 5–50% lower than the average modelled water age in the Cut-closed scenarios and 68–82% lower in the Cut-open scenarios, indicating the seawater fluxes are considerably over-estimated with the bulk flushing time method, especially after the Cut construction. The flushing time method assumes the estuary is fully mixed as a box model, which is not the case given the shallow and complex morphometry of the PHE system. These changes suggest strong incomplete mixing of the ocean flushing, which results in a lower tidal exchange ratio (Sheldon and Alber, 2006). Therefore the concept of flushing time is not appropriate in this large shallow lagoon and heterogeneity in the water age distribution needs to be considered from the model results. It also has implications since incomplete mixing will lead to area-specific retention of nutrients, and therefore affect local biogeochemistry such as pelagic denitrification and P burial rates (e.g. Almroth-Rosell et al., 2016). Figure 3.6: Comparison of average water age ($ au\\() and bulk flushing time (\\) au_{f}$) in (a) summertime and (b) wintertime in the PHE. 3.4.3 Past and future hotspots of water retention Water retention is highly dynamic depending on seasonal flows, tidal conditions, and different regions of the estuary. The evolution of water age, \\(\\tau\\), over time has shown a general increase from 1970 to the present, superimposed on the effect of the Cut, however, with some considerable variation across the two lagoons (Fig. 3.7). Firstly, wet season (winter and spring) conditions were more sensitive to the changes in the drying climate. In the “no-Cut” scenarios (assuming the artificial channel was not constructed), it was predicted that τ would have increased in the Peel Inlet from about 50 days in 1970 to nearly double in 2016 and increased from approximately 50 days in 1970 to nearly 150 days in 2016 in the Harvey Estuary, solely due to the drying climate trend. In contrast, the dry season (summer and autumn) conditions did not show as significant changes over time in most parts of the estuary, except in the south Harvey Estuary, which is furthest from the channels. These effects are masked by the effects of opening of the Cut, which had a prominent effect by reducing the \\(\\tau\\) by about 20–45 days in the Peel Inlet, and more profoundly by 50–100 days in the Harvey Estuary. Yet the drying climate has largely canceled out the flushing effect by the Cut on the water age in some regions. The increases in \\(\\tau\\) from 1998 to 2016, due to reduced inflows, are in the same magnitudes of that reduced by the Cut opening. For example, the Cut opening reduced the \\(\\tau\\) by 28 days in the west Peel Inlet in 1998, yet the \\(\\tau\\) increased by 27 days from 1998 to 2016 due to the reduced flows. Lastly, the Harvey Estuary was most influenced by the climate changes and the Cut opening. North Harvey Estuary, directly connected to the Cut, was most impacted by the Cut opening with the \\(\\tau\\) was reduced by more than 110 days. The south Harvey Estuary, which is furthest from both the channels, was more sensitive to climate change, showing greatest variation over the past decades. Figure 3.7: Mean water retention time in east Peel Inlet, west Peel Inlet, north Harvey Estuary, and south Harvey Estuary (see Fig. 1 for their domain definition). The data were categorized into four seasons: spring (September, October, November), summer (December, January, February), autumn (March, April, May), and winter (June, July, August). 3.4.4 Increasing salinity and changing patterns of stratification Similar to \\(\\tau\\), the evolution of salinity in response to the drying climate showed large variability in space and time, yet the impact of the Cut-opening on salinity was more complex (Fig. 3.8). In the “no-Cut” scenarios, the mean salinity during the wet season increased from &lt;20 psu in 1970 to over 30 psu in 2016. In the dry season, the changes in salinity were relatively smaller over time. The Cut-opening could increase or decrease the salinity in the estuary, depending on the salinity within the estuary at the time, compared to the ocean salinity of ~ 36 psu. If the estuary salinity was lower than the ocean salinity, the Cut-opening enhanced the salinity level, and vice versa. For example, the salinity in the north Harvey Estuary increased from 17.5 psu to 28.3 psu in the spring of 1998 by the Cut-opening, yet reduced from 51.8 to 39.8 psu by the opening of the Cut in the autumn. The Cut opening has relatively smaller influence on the salinity of Peel Inlet where has connection with ocean via not only the Cut but also the Mandurah Channel. The projected climate is expected to slightly increase the salinity in the Peel Inlet and Harvey Estuary, mostly in winters and springs. Hypersalinity was often observed in summer and autumn in the Peel Inlet from both the ‘Cut-open’ and ‘no-Cut’ scenarios. The Harvey Estuary shows an increasing salinity with the drying climate in summer and becomes hypersaline after 2011. High salinity with values over 50 PSU were observed in autumn in South Harvey Estuary in the ‘no-Cut’ scenarios, whilst the Cut-opening reduced the hypersalinity likelihood in autumn in the Harvey Estuary. The relationship between the hypersalinity and the catchment inflows are further investigated with monitoring data at six regular monitoring sites (Fig. 3.9), which shows the maximum salinity recorded in autumn increased with reduced inflows, especially in the period before the Cut-opening. Opening of the Cut reduced the maximum salinity at the sites near the Cut (site PH2 and PH58), under an annual flow threshold of about 1000 GL/year. The hypersalinity risk is shown to increase with distance to the channels, especially in site PH31 in the south Harvey Estuary where salinity &gt;45 psu was often observed after Cut-opening. The maximum salinity can also be affected by other factors, such as accidental rainfall events in summers. However, it can be concluded that the risk of hypersalinity increased due to the drying climate, and the Cut-opening reduced the sensitivity of maximum salinity to the changes in inflow rates. The magnitude of salinity stratification (salinity difference between the bottom and surface water) in winter and spring has shown a declining trend with the drying climate, while the variations are small in summer and autumn (Fig. 3.10). The opening of the Cut introduces more ocean water intrusion, which creates a stronger salt-stratification in the wet seasons when it interacts with the freshwater inflows. The salt-stratification in the Peel Inlet was enhanced by the Cut opening in the wet seasons but that has gradually diminished with the reduction if the inflows, and there is increasing stratification in wet season within the Murray River (Fig. 3.11). The maximum mean salinity difference in spring time was over 10 psu in 1970, which then decreased to about 3 psu in 1998 and was mostly &lt;1 psu in the 2060 projection scenario, indicating weaker stratification due to the reduced inflow. The Cut enhanced the stratification in the Harvey Estuary, especially the northern part, and it also has shown a declining trend with the reduction in inflows. Figure 3.8: Same as Fig. 7, except for mean salinity evolution. Figure 3.9: Maximum salinity recorded in March/April and the annual inflow in the hydrologic year (March to March) at 6 monitoring sites (see the site locations in Fig. 1). Figure 3.10: Same as Fig. 7, except for mean salinity-stratification. Figure 3.11: Stratification intensity model outputs, comparing pre (1978 and 1990, top panel) and post (1998 and 2016, bottom panel) Cut conditions. 3.4.5 Implications for estuary management The Cut had an obvious and dramatic effect on increasing the export of nutrients that would have otherwise been retained (Fig. 3.12). Since the Cut opening in 1994 the main monitoring stations have shown TN as being stable around 0.5mg/L and TP has declined from 0.05 to 0.02 mg/L over time. Importantly, the increasing rate of exchange has made the estuary concentration of nutrients less sensitive to the inflow load (as demonstrated by the reduction in slope of 11c and d). The results have, however, revealed an increase in τ associated with the drying climate that has eroded some of the benefits associated with increased flushing following the construction of the Cut, and further reductions in flows will cause less flushing and will likely lead to a tendency for increasing nutrient accumulation over time. Importantly, this is also now manifesting in reduced flushing and higher concentrations in the riverine portions of the domain that are not clearly depicted in the long-term data shown in Fig. 11. This is explored by looking at the nutrient loading and export rates in more detail in other components of this ARC Linkage Project (see Hipsey et al., 2019a; b). Figure 3.12: Changes in the mean nutrient concentration of (a) TN and (b) TP in the Peel-Harvey Estuary (based on the average of the 6 main monitoring stations), and their relationship with the total annual nutrient loading (c and d). The hydrologic changes led to not only changes in the nutrient levels but also the mean salinity, with potential ramifications for the ecological community. In particular, the phytoplankton biomass dropped dramatically since the Cut opening (Fig. 3.2) due to the improvement of ocean connectivity and flushing, but also due to a less desirable salinity regime for the toxic cyanobacteria Nodularia spumigena that plagued the Harvey Estuary before the Cut opening. The biomass of macroalgae has also decreased in the Peel Inlet, while it has increased in the Harvey Estuary since the Cut opening, which potentially reflecting the reduced nutrient concentrations, increased salinities and/or greater light availability (Pedretti et al., 2011). The biomass of some benthic macroinvertebrates, such as the blue swimmer crabs (Portunus armatus) and the Western king prawn (Penaeus latisulcatus) also showed an increase with the Cut opening and the reduced flow in recent years (Johnston et al., 2014). These trends seem to continue as our models predict a constant low flushing and high saline future in this estuary. Aside from changes in flushing and the mean salinity fields, the annual variability of salinity along the rivers has indicated there is an increasing risk of hypersalinity in the Serpentine River and an upward moving of the salt-wedge in the Murray River (Fig. 3.13). For example, the mean salinity at the Serpentine River mouth is about 20 psu in 1970, then increased to 24 psu in 1998 and projected to increase to over 30 psu in 2060. In the upstream areas of the Serpentine River, the mean salinity increased faster from about 15 psu in 1970 to near 35 psu. While there is no hypersalinity risk in the Murray River due to stronger freshwater flushing, the trend of increasing salinity along the river drives stratification which is a known driver of hypoxia and fish-kill events. The differences between the Cut-closed and Cut-open scenarios in year 1998 are much smaller than that caused by the drying climate, which concludes the drying climate is the major cause of the salinity changes in the rivers. Figure 3.13: Longitudinal gradient in annual salinity variability in four selected scenarios (1970, 1998 without the Cut opening, 1998 with the Cut opening, and a future scenario 2060 with assumptions of reduced flow and sea level rise) moving upstream along the (a) Serpentine River and (b) Murray River. 3.5 Conclusions This chapter has sought to disentangle the effect of the recent climate change trend on the hydrologic evolution in the Peel-Harvey Estuary, relative to the changes brought about by construction of the Dawesville Cut. The Cut was effective in significantly reducing the water retention time, especially in areas on the Western side, while the drying climate trend has acted to increase the water retention time. The artificial channel enhanced the ocean intrusion, which has a mutual effect with the drying climate to increase the estuary salinity during the wet season, but it had opposite effect of reducing the hypersalinity in the dry season. The drying climate reduced the salinity stratification in the main body of the estuary, while the artificial channel increased the seawater fluxes and the salinity stratification, mostly in the Harvey Estuary. The changes are increasing the stresses on the riverine portion of the study domain. The changes in the water retention time and salinity have led to fundamental changes in nutrient levels and habitat of pelagic and benthic communities. Future consideration of the projected drying trend and effects of sea level rise is essential in designing management plans associated with planning for environmental water provision and setting water quality loading targets. 3.6 Acknowledgements We thank Dr. Jatin Kala and Dr. Julia Andrys for providing meteorological data from their Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model.

The results showed that (1) there was a declining trend of nutrient inputs from the catchment into the PHE, driven by a reduction in flows and nutrient management measures in the catchment; (2) the role of the PHE system in filtering catchment nutrient inputs has changed due to the opening of the Dawesville Cut (e.g., addition of the Cut on average improved the TN export from 50% to 71%, and TP export from 31% to 49% of annual catchment loading, and the nutrient export via the Cut is about 2–3 times of that through the Mandurah Channel); (3) the PHE system has a significant spatial heterogeneity in water quality in response to catchment loading; (4) the estuary response model well reproduced the nutrient pools and water quality evolution in PHE especially in the post-Cut period, suggesting in its current form it is suitable for assessing management scenarios associated with nutrient load management or climate change; and (5) estuary response functions were developed to simplify models and showed locations near the channels are less sensitive to the catchment inputs, as well as that the Harvey Estuary displays a stronger salinity and phytoplankton biomass response to the catchment inputs compared to the Peel Inlet. Key findings: A reconstruction of nutrient loads over time, including relative nutrient species partitioning, has shown the long-term reduction in load, but relative stability in flow-weighted inflow concentrations. Continual changes in water quality have occurred in the estuary over time, including following the Cut and as well as a long-term response following the reduced flows. The high-resolution Peel-Harvey Estuary Response Model has been able to capture water quality variability across regions from rivers to lagoons and channels. The model has allowed the reconstruction of spatiotemporal variability in key water quality attributes and processes impacting the nutrient load partitioning within the estuary. Zonal budgets were undertaken to identify local controls on carbon and nutrient metabolism, and to determine how these respond to changes in flow and catchment loading. The pattern of retention and export has changed over time, following the Cut in particular, but recent changes also due to the reduced inflows. The amount of retention is dependent on annual flow, and therefore maybe sensitive to forecast projections due to drying climate. 4.2 Background The Peel-Harvey Estuary (PHE) system, located within the south-west Australian region, is surrounded by a large catchment of ~11,940 km2 (Kelsey et al., 2011), including the coastal city of Mandurah which is one of the fastest growing cities in the state. Like many other urban estuaries and coastal embayments around the world ( Eyre, 2000; Howarth and Marino, 2006; Howarth et al., 2011; Greening et al., 2014; Cloern et al., 2017;), the PHE received excessive anthropogenic nutrient loading from the catchment and has exhibited signs of environmental stress due to eutrophication, such as fish kills, cyanobacteria and other algal blooms (Potter et al., 2016; Valesini et al., 2019). The severity of eutrophication in PHE led to the construction of an artificial channel, termed the “Dawesville Cut” (hereafter referred as “the Cut”), in 1994, with the purpose of enhancing ocean flushing therefore reducing nutrient levels within the estuary. Monitoring data has shown that the Cut was effective in reducing the water nutrient and phytoplankton concentrations (Brearley, 2005), however, the PHE system is still under stress of catchment development and climate change. The population in Mandurah had increased more than double from 2006 to 2016 (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2018). At the same time, the Peel region experienced a drying climate followed by a rapid decline in runoff to the estuary (Silberstein et al., 2012; Valesini et al., 2019). While the changing status of the PHE ecosystem has been reported through analysis of water quality monitoring and ecological survey data (e.g. Brearley, 2005; Pedretti et al., 2011; Johnston et al., 2014; Valesini et al., 2019)Hallett et al., 2012; , there remains uncertainty as to how the water quality changes have occurred in response to the varied environmental stresses the system has experienced. The changing hydrological patterns experienced by the system (Huang et al., 2019a) has implications for the rates of nutrient retention and cycling, and manifestation of poor water quality (e.g. hypoxia, algal blooms). The need to effectively balance the water quality status with development opportunities to support economic and societal growth in the PHE region confronts managers as a ‘wicked problem’, and requires knowledge of the past and present state of the estuarine condition and an understanding of how it will responds to environmental stresses (Patterson et al., 2013; Barnard and Elliott, 2015). Water quality response models, integrated with the long term monitoring data, are particularly useful in this regard by linking hydrologic changes (e.g. changing water retention and flushing) with nutrient loading and in-estuary biogeochemical transformations, thereby allowing nutrient budgeting and regional water quality risk assessment (Huang et al., 2019b). The development of response models are also essential tools to support long-term and complex land-use planning decisions, climate change scenarios, and restoration measures (Hipsey et al., 2015; Janssen et al., 2015; Honti et al., 2017). To date, there has been no estuarine response model for the PHE, and therefore uncertainty as to how the system is responding to large scale changes in hydrology and catchment management. 4.3 Objectives This report seeks improved understanding of water quality responses to the environmental perturbations in the PHE, considering nutrient retention and cycling, through integration of the historical monitoring data and development of a new estuary response model. The main objectives are as follows: Identify the seasonal and inter-annual characteristics of water quality changes in pre- and post-Cut periods; Develop the Peel-Harvey Estuary Response Model (PHERM) and evaluate the performance in reconstructing the long-term changes in water quality; Provide a synoptic view of changes to the nutrient budget of the PHE system, including the catchment loading, the estuary retention/assimilation capability, and rates of export to the ocean; Build estuary response functions (ERF) to identify the impacts of drying climate and Dawesville Cut on the changes of key water quality parameters (DO, TCHLA, clarity, nutrient retention). 4.4 Approach 4.4.1 Data review and compliation A comprehensive data review and compilation process was undertaken to provide the necessary data for model setup, validation and assessment. Available monitoring data was sourced from: Marine and Freshwater Research Laboratory (MAFRL, 1977-2001), Department of Water and Environmental Regulation (DWER) Water Information Reporting (WIR, 2001-2018), Murdoch University biogeochemical field surveys (MU, 2016-2018), and Southern Cross University nutrient and isotope surveys (SCU, 2017). The data from these sources are summarized in Table 1 and sampling locations are shown in Fig. 4.1, and was standardised to facilitate comparison. Figure 4.1: Data sources and their sampling locations superimposed on the PHERM simulation domain. 4.4.2 The Peel Harvey Estuary Response Model (PHERM) An estuary water quality response model was developed to gain insights into the nutrient budgeting and regional water quality response to changing environmental inputs. The water quality response model consists of a 3D hydrodynamic model TUFLOW-FV (as described in Huang et al., 2019a), which is dynamically coupled with the AED2 water quality model to simulate the nutrient cycling and key biogeochemical processes (Hipsey et al., 2019). The AED2 water quality modules were configured to simulate the C, N, P, and DO budgets, including resolving the inorganic nutrients and organic matter fractions, and primary production (Table 1; Fig. 4.1). Spatial variation and sediment quality and benthic properties (including biomass of seagrass, macroalgae and bivalves) was also included. Key modelled chemical and biological processes include: Water column kinetic (time-varying) chemical / biological transformations (e.g., denitrification or algal growth) Water column equilibrium (instantaneous) chemical transformations (e.g., PO4 adsorption) Vertical sedimentation or migration Biogeochemical transformations in the sediment or biological changes in the benthos Fluxes across the air-water interface Fluxes across the sediment-water interface Feedback of chemical or biological attributes to physical properties of water (light extinction, drag, density) For more details of the AED model and its numerical methods the readers are referred to the AED website. The model domain, mesh, and hydrodynamic settings (weather forcing, tide and inflows) in PHERM were updated from that presented in Huang et al. (2019a) to have improved resolution in selected areas of interest after consulting stakeholders. The sediment was separated into 24 zones based on their properties (sand/silt composition and N/P contents) based on the survey data presented in Hallett et al. (2019). Water quality in the inflow waters were set based on the raw or daily infilled data from WIR, or from the catchment model (Hennig et al 2019) where no gauged data was available. The final version, PHERM v11, was run for 16 selected years from 1979 to 2017, including 6 years in the pre-Cut period and 10 years in the post-Cut period, spanning a range of hydrologic conditions for each. Model parameters were set initially in accordance with settings used in similar systems (Bruce et al., 2014; Huang et al., 2019b), but were then adjusted based on detailed comparisons with field data through a process or error assessment. All available data was compiled into 24 Estuary Response Zones (ERZs) and used to identify calibration issues specific to different regions (e.g. rivers vs lagoons). Generally, the model parameter-set was common across all simulations. The models output all variables across the domain at 2-hourly internals for each of the 16 annual simulations, and these were also used for nutrient budgeting at the estuary scale, and also in each ERZ. The resultant predictions were also used to develop simpler Estuary Response Functions (ERFs) to illustrate typical patterns of water quality response to flow and nutrient input in different areas of the system. Figure 4.2: AED water quality model diagram summarising interactions captured with the PHERM. 4.5 Main Findings 4.5.1 Synoptic view of long-term water quality changes The monitored key water quality variables show strong seasonal signals, and the obvious response to the increased flushing brought about by the opening of the Cut (Fig. 4.3). In general, the salinity decreases, and TN/TP concentrations increased during the wet season following catchment loading (see also Fig. 4.7). The opening of the Cut enhanced the ocean water intrusion, therefore lifting salinity and reducing the mean concentrations of TN, TP and TCHLA since 1994. The annual-averaged TN concentration decreased from over 2.0 mg/L in the pre-Cut period to about 0.5 mg/L after the Cut opening, while the annual-averaged TP decreased from over 0.1 mg/L to about 0.03 mg/L. Variability in oxygen, and seasonal low oxygen in the lagoons, has also reduced since 1994. Figure 4.3: Synoptic view of the water quality evolution in the Peel Inlet (left panels) and Harvey Estuary (right panels) from 1979 to 2017. The symbol shapes indicate the data sources; blue indicates data measured within the surface waters and orange indicates data measured at the bottom. The brown arrows indicate the time when the Dawesville Cut was constructed. 4.5.2 Reduction in catchment nutrient loading The catchment nutrient loading data were created from a synthesis of catchment river monitoring data, catchment model outputs and statistical modelling to allow the long-term comparison of loads and nutrient partitioning. The data shows a significant reduction in the annual TN and TP loading into the PHE system, following the reduction of annual inflows (Fig. 4.4). The flow-normalised annual mean nitrogen concentrations remained relatively stable from 1970 to 2016, while there was significant declining trend in the TP concentration. The linear regression shows the total annual inflow dropped by 268.9 GL (39.8%) from 1970 to 2017, while the total annual TN loading dropped by 501.6 tonnes (44.6%) and the total annual TP loading dropped by 69.6 tonnes (50.9%), indicating not only the reduction of nutrient loading due to the inflow decline, but also the efforts of catchment nutrient control, especially on phosphorus. Figure 4.4: Annual-mean of (a) TN and (b) TP concentrations in all inflows entering the PHE estuary (8 gauged plus 16 ungauged), and the annual loading of (c) flow, (d) TN, and (e) TP. 4.5.3 PHERM performance in reconstructing the water quality changes The performance of PHE water quality response model in reproducing the estuary states was extensively assessed against data from the regular monitoring sites and also event-based monitoring data, for all simulated water quality attributes (water temperature, salinity, oxygen (DO), total chlorophyll-a (TCHLA), TN, TP, turbidity, ammonium, nitrate, phosphate), and where possible surface and bottom values were individually assessed. The model validation were categorized into ‘site validation’ where the model results were validated against site measurement, and ‘estuary response validation’ where higher level trends in ecosystem response between the model and monitoring data were compared. Validation summaries at site are presented below relevant to nutrients, DO, and TCHLA. Full validation results are archived and can be viewed online through the project data-report database. Site validation examples are shown in Figs. 4.5 and 4.6 for PH1 (center of Harvey Estuary) and site PH7 (center of Peel Inlet), respectively. The model was able to accurately reproduce salinity and temperature in the estuary, and captured well the variations in dissolved oxygen and variation the nutrient pools such as TN and TP, though some over-prediction was occurring in the nutrient pools in the latter years. The model performance is further illustrated in Fig. 4.7 where monthly changes in water quality are aggregated to pre- and post-Cut periods and compared to monitoring data. The model well re-produced the seasonal variations in salinity, temperature, and nutrient levels, especially in the post-Cut period. In the pre-Cut period, the model under-predicted the salinity and nutrient concentrations, possibly due to the poor boundary condition setting in these periods when the quantity and quality of weather and catchment forcing were poor and were subject to numerous in-filling assumptions. However, the monthly-mean and deviation in the post-Cut period from the model output well matched the monitoring data. More importantly, the model response of key water attributes to the environmental inputs are close to the observational data (Fig. 4.8), suggesting that in its present form, the model is suitable for assessing management scenarios associated with nutrient load management or climate change. Figure 4.5: Time history plot of key water quality variables from model output (dark line, monthly moving-average) and monitoring data (golden open circles, weekly/fortnightly interval) at site PH1 (center of Harvey Estuary). The model performance was evaluated with regression coefficient (r), mean absolute error (mae) and root-mean square error (rms) shown in the right panels. More detailed validation analyses of all measured variables for all years and regions are available online. Figure 4.6: Same as Fig. 5, except for site PH7 (center of Peel Inlet).

Figure 4.8: Response of S, TN, TP, and DO concentrations at site PH1to inflow comparing model outputs and observations, separated into pre- and post-Cut periods. 4.5.4 Nutrient retention and transportation As the interface between the land and ocean, the PHE system can act to retain or export nutrients to ocean, depending on the balance of catchment loading and ocean flushing. This is depicted clearly from a comparison of model output across 4 pre- and 4 post-Cut years (Fig. 4.9). Analysis of the model results shows that the PHE generally retains nutrients, with up to ~600 tons of TN and ~150 tons of TP retained per annum in the pre-Cut period, mostly in organic forms, due to restricted ocean flushing via the only Mandurah Channel (Fig. 4.10). The Cut construction effectively improved the nutrient export efficiency. The mean nitrogen export ratio (ocean export per unit catchment loading) was estimated to be ~50% in the pre-Cut period, but increased to 71.3% in the post-Cut period, while the mean phosphorus export ratio increased from 30.6% in pre-Cut period to 49.4% in post-Cut period. The PHE nutrient retention capability (defined as the difference between the catchment loading and ocean export) showed a negative relationship to the catchment loading in the post-Cut period, and the PHE showed net export under the annual-inflow loading threshold of ~350 GL/year when the export exceeded the catchment loading. Figure 4.9: Spring average (a) water age and (b) TN across 8 simulated years, demonstrating the large change in potential for nutrient flushing and retention. Figure 4.10: Annual nutrient budget for (a) nitrogen and (b) phosphorus showing the balance between the catchment input and estuary export; and (c) estuary retention capability vs. annual inflow rate, showing the tendency to switch to net nutrient export below a critical catchment inflow volume. The effect of the Cut construction on the water transportation is further illustrated in Fig. 4.11, which shows the TN/TP fluxes transported through interior transects within the PHE. In a selected pre-Cut hydrologic year, about 40% of TN and 27% of TP was exported to ocean. Much of the nutrients entering from the Harvey River were retained in the Harvey Estuary, due to the poor flushing in this region at this time. In a post-Cut year (2016) however, over 70% of nutrients from the Harvey River were exported out of the Harvey Estuary region. This result matches the analysis of the water retention in the hydrology analysis by Huang et al. (2019) that the Cut-opening effectively improved the flushing effect, especially in the Harvey Estuary, therefore notably reducing the nutrient levels. Figure 4.11: Whole estuary view of annual TN/TP fluxes transported by currents through the system comparing 1979 (left) and 2016 (right). The size of the arrow indicates the flux rates relative to the inputs. Note the large Murray River in put in the 2016 hydrologic year is attributable to the Feb 2017 summer flood event. The stocks and internal fluxes of the carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus in the PHE were also computed and display the overlapping seasonal cycles of catchment loading and estuary metabolism (production and respiration) (Fig. 4.12). The nutrient stocks in particle and dissolved forms changed following the catchment inputs. They increased in the wet season (July and August) and, in the selected year of 2017, also increased in February due to the summer storm event that occurred whereby catchment loading exceeded the export. Organic matter is the major form of the various nutrient stocks. The primary production and respiration intensity also varies seasonally within a notable increase in summer relative to winter, despite the majority of the nutrient inputs entering in the winter. Nitrification and denitrification also played fundamental roles in the nitrogen cycle, contributing up to 2 tonnes/day in the estuary, whilst particle organic matter sedimentation was a major sink of water column nitrogen and phosphorus. Figure 4.12: Daily changes in the carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus stocks and their internal fluxes within the PHE (budgeted area including the Peel Inlet and Harvey Estuary regions). 4.5.5 Regional water quality response to catchment inputs PHE presents high heterogeneity in the distributions of both hydrology such as salinity and water retention time (see the Huang et al., 2019 hydrology analysis), and for water quality attributes making it difficult to make broad statements about water quality response to changing conditions. It is therefore warranted to undertake a “regional” analysis of local water quality changes to catchment inputs, in addition to the whole estuary nutrient budgeting and water quality analysis described above. This approach breaks the system into Estuary Response Zones and seeks to identify how water quality in (selected) zones is impacted by changing environmental drivers. 4.5.5.1 Salinity response The local salinity is sensitive to the catchment inflows (Fig. 4.13). In the pre-Cut years, the salinity showed a faster decrease with the inflows, especially in the Harvey Estuary where the salinity dropped quickly to below 10 PSU when inflow rates &gt; ~50 GL/week. The Cut-opening increase the salinity but a general decrease of salinity in response to inflow can still be observed. The salinity at the locations near the channels (site PH2 and PH58) are less ‘sensitive’ to the inflows due to the mixing with ocean water, compared to other sites further to the channels. Figure 4.13: Monitored salinity at 6 routine monitoring sites in PHE vs. weekly catchment inflow. 4.5.5.2 Salinity stratification response The stratification degrees (defined as the salinity difference between the surface and bottom water) showed a general increase with the catchment inflows (Fig. 4.14), although there are large deviations in the response due to the fact that other factors such as wind mixing and current movements can also affect the salinity stratification. The response of stratification is stronger in the post-Cut period, especially in the Harvey Estuary, maybe because the Cut-opening enhanced ocean water intrusion that subsequently led to higher salinity in the bottom water. Figure 4.14: Monitored salinity stratification at 6 routine monitoring sites in PHE vs. weekly catchment inflow. 4.5.5.3 TN and TP response The regional TN concentration shows a positive relationship with the catchment TN input in both the pre- and post-Cut periods, although the concentration in the post-Cut periods are lower (Fig. 4.15). The TN at the sites close to the channels (site PH2 and PH58) show slighter ‘sensitivity’ to the catchment, compared to other sites further to the channels. The regional TP concentration response is similar to TN, showing a positive relationship to the catchment input and slighter ‘sensitivity’ at the sites close to the channels (site PH2 and PH58) compared to other sites further to the channels (Fig. 4.16). Figure 4.15: Monitored TN concentration at 6 routine monitoring sites in PHE vs. weekly catchment TN loading. Figure 4.16: Monitored TP concentration at 6 routine monitoring sites in PHE vs. weekly catchment TP loading. 4.5.5.4 Oxygen response The oxygen concentration at the bottom water shows large deviation to the catchment flows (Fig. 4.17), due to the facts that the oxygen was also impacted by many other factors such as wind speeds and primary production/respiration. The post-Cut period shows a general decrease of bottom oxygen concentration in response to the inflows, maybe due to the enhancement of salinity stratification (Fig. 4.14) that inhibits the oxygen exchange from the surface water. Figure 4.17: Monitored bottom oxygen concentration at 6 routine monitoring sites in PHE vs. weekly catchment inflow. 4.5.5.5 Maximum phytoplankton biomass response The maximum phytoplankton biomass recorded in the summertime in response to the catchment inflows demonstrates different behaviors in the Peel Inlet and Harvey Estuary (Fig. 4.18). The Harvey Estuary shows a general increase of the maximum phytoplankton biomass to the catchment inputs in both the pre- and post-Cut periods, although the biomass in the post-Cut period was significantly reduced, especially at site PH58 which is close to the Cut. In comparison, the response in the Peel Inlet is less significant, although the decrease of phytoplankton biomass with Cut-opening can still be observed, except for site PH4 which is shallow and adjacent to the mouth of Murray River. Figure 4.18: Maximum annual phytoplankton biomass vs. annual inflow in hydrologic year for 6 routine monitoring sites in PHE. 4.6 Conclusions The changes in the key water quality attributes and nutrient budgets of Peel-Harvey Estuary were analysed through integration of long-term monitoring data and a high-resolution water quality response model. The analysis validated in detail the model performance against the available data from 1979–2018 and the estuary response to climate change, catchment loading, and Dawesville Cut construction was assessed. The water quality presents present clear seasonal and interannual shifts following the Mediterranean climate and a drying trend. The reconstruction of nutrient load and its relative nutrient species partitioning over time shows reduction in load due to decreasing inflows and slight decreases in the flow-weighted nutrient concentrations. The high-resolution water quality response model, termed PHERM) is shown to capture variability across regions from rivers to lagoons and channels, and reproduce the spatiotemporal variability in key water quality attributes and processes. Nutrient budgeting analysis within the estuary was resolved with the water response model, which shows pattern of retention and export has changed over time, following cut in particular, and also the drying climate. The opening of the Dawesville Cut effectively improved the ocean flushing and, on average, improved the TN and TP export efficiency, with the nutrient export via the Cut now about 2–3 times of that via the Mandurah Channel. The results have shown that the amount of nutrient retention is dependent on the annual flow volume the estuary receives, and therefore maybe sensitive to forecast projections due to drying climate. Zonal response models were used to identify local controls on metabolism, which showed locations near the channels were less sensitive to the catchment inputs, whilst the Harvey Estuary response displayed a stronger salinity and phytoplankton biomass response to the catchment inputs compared to Peel Inlet. 4.7 Acknowledgements The authors acknowledge the Casper Boon from UWA and the NCRIS Nectar cloud computing infrastructure for supporting the model computational requirements.

Wells1, Mustefa Yasin Reshid1, Karl Hennig2, Daren Gooddy3, Bradley Eyre1 1 Centre of Coastal Biogeochemistry, Southern Cross University, East Lismore, NSW 2 Department of Water and Environmental Regulation, Perth, WA 3 British Geological Survey, Wallingford, Oxfordshire, United Kingdom 5.1 Abstract The overarching aim of this component of the ARC Linkage Project was to characterise the source, form and biological controls on nutrient inputs to the Peel-Harvey Estuary. We achieved this by first assessing the dominant forms of nitrogen and phosphorus found in the catchment sources (e.g. groundwater, rainwater, wastewater effluent and soil water) and in the receiving waters (e.g. drains, farm dams, rivers and the estuary basins). We then developed isotope-based indicators for the biological transformations that could limit the downstream flow of excess nitrogen. This approach revealed that (1) both groundwater and rainwater could bring excess reactive nitrogen to the estuary; (2) shallow receiving waters like drains and creeks play a critical role in removing excess nitrogen before it reaches the estuary, and; (3) up to 100% of inorganic nitrogen sources to the catchment are biologically-removed during downstream transport. Together, these findings lay the foundation for improved catchment-estuary nutrient modelling, as well as some directions around drain management that could help maximise nutrient removal, rather than simply water removal. 5.2 Introduction &amp; Background There is a long history of concern about excess nutrients leading to the over-enrichment of organic matter (eutrophication) in the Peel Harvey Estuary (Bradby, 1997; McComb et al., 1981). However, relatively little is known about how the nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) that cause this over-enrichment to reach the estuary. Understanding how, why, where, and when nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) move from sources like agricultural soils and wastewater treatment plants to the estuary, is a critical (but complex) step in being able to effectively manage eutrophication in this system. This complexity stems, from the fact that microbes and vegetation can remove up to 100%, or as little as 0%, of excess nitrogen as it’s transported downstream from the catchment and/or atmospheric sources. This component of the ARC Linkage Project aims to improve knowledge of nutrient transport and transformations across the Peel Harvey system by measuring changes in the isotopic composition of different N and P forms. This approach is based on the knowledge that both the different nutrient pollution sources and the biological processes that limit nutrient transport downstream will impart unique isotopic ‘fingerprints’, or signatures. Characterising the fingerprints for the different sources and processes could enable us to measure how efficiently nutrients moved through different portions of the catchment to the estuary. This type of isotope tracing approach has been successfully used in other temperate waterways to determine the extent of their eutrophication (Gooddy et al., 2016) or the particular nitrogen sources most responsible for driving this eutrophication (Xue et al., 2012). Detailed information on the origin, form and fate of nutrients across the Peel-Harvey catchment generated through this component of the ARC Linkage Project is designed to fill gaps in the catchment nutrient export model (presented in the complementary ARC Linkage report Kilminster et al., 2019), and set the scene for future targeted work to improve ecosystem health in the identified ‘at risk’ zones (Cronin-O’Reilly et al., 2019; Chris S. Hallett et al., 2019b). 5.3 Objectives Identify the dominant sources and forms of nutrients moving through the Peel-Harvey catchment and estuary. Assess the potential of isotopic tools to distinguish the identified nutrient sources. Identify the catchment locations and events that enhance nitrogen removal (biogeochemical ‘hot spots’ and ‘hot moments’). Evaluate the added value of incorporating isotope measurements into catchment nitrogen export models. 5.4 Approach 5.4.1 Conceptual model: Isotope fate and transport The conceptual model underpinning our work is based on the knowledge that different nitrogen (and maybe phosphorus) sources have unique concentrations of heavy vs light isotopes, and that biological removal of nitrogen (by processes including denitrification and assimilation into organic biomass) will preferentially remove only light isotopes (Fig. 1). This model informed our study design: we set out to evaluate the concentrations and isotopic composition of different nutrient sources across the Peel-Harvey catchment, and then track those sources as they moved through the complex network of drains, aquifers, farm dams, lakes and finally the estuary. Figure 5.1: Different nutrient sources (e.g. livestock waste, wastewater treatments, rain) have different quantities of heavy vs light isotopes. These sources will mix in surface waters, where biological removal will again alter the ratio of heavy to light isotopes by preferentially removing the latter. 5.4.2 Sample collection We collected samples from both receiving waters (defined as surface waters in the catchment and estuary) and N and P sources (defined as soils, fertilisers, and the non-surface waters that could directly flow to the surface water; Table 1). This sampling design enabled us to build a biogeochemical understanding onto the known hydrologic flow paths linking ‘sources’ and ‘receiving waters’ and avoid extraneous or duplicate sampling. For instance, we sampled soil water (which could directly leach into creeks, drains and rivers), but not the nitrogen fertilisers and livestock excreta that are applied to these soils (Table 1). The location of all sampling points is shown in Fig. 2, with most being sampled in both summer (February–March 2017) and winter (July–August 2017; see Table 5.1) for exceptions). Table 5.1: Summary of sampled sources and receiving waters. Note that soils and storm drains were only sampled during the high flow season (winter 2017), while the rest were sampled in both summer and winter. Site category Description Sources Shallow groundwater, rainwater, soils (leachable N and P), fertilisers (P only), wastewater treatment plant, urban storm drains Receiving waters Feeder drains, farm dams, creeks and main drains, tidal rivers (Murray, Serpentine, and Harvey), and estuary basins (Peel Inlet and Harvey Estuary) In addition to the above sampling of sources and receiving waters, high-resolution temporal sampling (24 h continuous measurements) of different forms of nitrogen were carried out at two estuary locations (Figure 5.2) in winter 2017 to assess how tides impacted their distributions.  Figure 5.2: Examples of the different types of water bodies sampled across the Peel-Harvey system. The different flow dynamics and biological structure of these water bodies could have a major impact on how efficiently they remove excess nutrients. Figure 5.3: A map of the Peel-Harvey catchment and estuary showing locations where isotope samples were collected. The farms where the soil and feeder drain samples are outlined in grey, and the drain (yellow circle) where the WWTP samples were collected is indicated. 5.4.3 Isotope analyses In each of the samples collected from the various sources and receiving waters (Table 5.1)), we first measured the concentration of the different species of P (dissolved organic P, and inorganic P, PO43-) and N (dissolved organic and inorganic N, as nitrate, NO3-, and ammonium, NH4+). We then analysed the isotope composition of the inorganic species.  For P, this involved sending samples to our colleagues at the British Geological Survey for processing, as described in Davies et al. (2014). Phosphate isotope (δ18O-PO43-) samples were limited to the main sources (fertilisers and soils) due to the large sample volume required for these analyses, the very time-intensive preparation steps, and the need for significant method development before these analyses can be readily applied to samples with complex organic matrices and high salinities, as found throughout most of the Peel-Harvey system.  Measuring the isotopic composition of N involved converting the two inorganic forms (NO3- and NH4+) to nitrous oxide (N2O), which we could then use to quantify the relative abundance of heavy to light isotopes for both N (δ15N) and O (δ18O). These analyses were performed in the stable isotope laboratory at Southern Cross University’s Centre for Coastal Biogeochemistry. For more details on these methods, see McIlvin and Casciotti (2011) and Zhang et al. (2007).  Figure 5.4: Analysing inorganic N isotope samples at the Centre for Coastal Biogeochemistry’s stable isotope lab (Lismore, NSW). 5.4.3.1 ‘What’: Characterize the sources and forms of catchment nutrients(Objectives 1 and 2) 5.4.3.1.1 Sources The main sources of P to the Peel-Harvey Estuary include fertilisers (rock phosphorus) leached through agricultural soils. The key sources of N include leaching from agricultural soils (which includes inputs from nitrogen fixing crops like clover and grazing livestock), effluent from wastewater treatment plants, inflows of historically contaminated groundwater, urban storm drains and rain water carrying reactive nitrogen mobilised from more distant (10–1,000 km) farms and industrial sources. We also evaluated the potential of precipitation to transport reactive nitrogen around the catchment. This is because ‘atmospheric transport’ can move nitrogen around agricultural catchments and confound traditional methods of identifying sources and sinks. The potential for rain to carry nitrogen has never been evaluated in Western Australia, so the importance of this nitrogen source to the Peel-Harvey system was unknown. Using the laboratory methods outlined above, samples of all of these sources were evaluated for the consistency of their isotope values, and thereby their usefulness for ‘fingerprinting’ these sources as they move through the catchment and estuary.  5.4.3.1.2 Forms Standard water quality models only consider nutrients as a ‘total’ of their forms (e.g. TN and TP). While this approach is efficient given the many chemical forms of both N and P that exist in the environment, it makes it difficult to accurately track changes in nutrient export. This is because, (1) the process used to measure TN and TP concentrations (persulfate oxidation of unfiltered samples) is imprecise and thus often obscures real changes occurring in the environment, and (2) the TN pool in particular is large and thus a fairly insensitive indicator of changes in nutrient pollution over space and time (Table 5.2)).  Figure 5.5: The sampling set-up used to measure gas concentrations across the Peel Harvey system. We also know that certain forms included in the TN pool, like nitrate (NO3-), exist in relatively low concentrations but can rapidly increase in response to human activities like N fertiliser use (Parfitt et al., 2012). This makes such inorganic forms (NO3- and NH4+) potentially more indicative of changes in pollution over space and time. The rest of the dissolved N pool is made up of organic molecules (DON), which can range from easily altered compounds like urea to large and non-biodegradable compounds (Sipler and Bronk, 2015). Therefore, the first objective that must be fulfilled in order to understand how nitrogen moves from land to the Peel-Harvey is to quantify the relative abundance and distribution of more labile nitrogen forms like NO3-, ammonium (NH4+), and DON.  Table 5.2: Summary of the different N forms commonly found in rivers and estuaries. Note that negatively charged N forms like NO3- are more readily transported in water than positively charged N forms like NH4+, which tends to stick to soil and sediment particles Form Charge Bioavailability Microbial reaction Organic Particulate N (particles &gt;0.45 µm diameter) +/- Low N  NH4+ DON (organic compounds &lt;0.45 µm diameter) +/- Low – High N  NH4+ Inorganic NH4+ High NH4+ NO3- NO3- Moderate NO3- N2O + N2 Total Sum of the above groups 5.4.3.2 ‘Where and When’: Identify nitrogen removal ‘hot spots’ and ’hot moments (Objective 3) Spatial variations in nitrogen removal To determine which regions of the catchment were more biologically active (and thus more likely to remove source nutrients), we measured N concentrations and isotopes across a range of receiving waters from small feeder drains on farms (shallow, seasonally flowing, vegetated) to large regional drains (permanently flowing, high velocity, channelized) to the Peel and Harvey estuaries (shallow with a large surface area; Table 1, Fig. 2). At these sites, we also used laser instruments to measure dissolved concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) gasses. Gas measurements are useful as they provide an independent indicator of biological productivity, and thus potential nutrient removal ‘hot spots’. This is because CO2, CH4, and N2O are produced by the same microorganisms that consume excess nitrogen.  Temporal variations in nitrogen removal We carried out the same isotope and dissolved gas measurements over both winter (high flow) and summer (low flow) seasons. As there was an anomalously large rainfall event in the Murray catchment during this summer, we sampled both before and after this ‘flood’. Unless otherwise noted the presented data is from the pre-flood (low flow) period. We further assessed the effect of extreme events on nutrient fluxes by sampling during a winter storm (wind speeds &gt;100 km h-1) very strong winds) in the Harvey Estuary. Seasonal variations in N forms, sources and removal were also assessed by measuring concentrations and isotopes in monthly samples from eight estuary sites that were collected for us by the Department of Environmental Regulation.  5.4.3.3 ‘Why’: Quantify implications for nitrogen export budgets (Objective 4) Current nutrient monitoring in the Peel-Harvey system (and thus the models based on this data) do not measure biological removal (‘attenuation’) processes that could occur as N is moved from catchment soils and/or rainfall sources to the waterways. A key aim of our isotope data was therefore to generate independent attenuation calculations that could be used to validate and improve the coupled catchment-estuary model being developed in other components of the current Linkage Project (Huang et al., 2019a, 2019b; Kilminster et al., 2019). Isotope-based calculations provide a measure of N removal that integrates N removal during transport to the sampled system and N removal within the sampled system. This approach will provide unique insight into the complex and poorly understood processes that occur as N is transported from land to water.  5.5 Results &amp; Findings 5.5.1 ‘What’: The majority of nitrogen in the Peel-Harvey is in organic forms Dissolved organic nitrogen (DON, that is, organic nitrogen smaller than 0.45 µm, see Table 2) dominated the nitrogen pool in all of the sampled surface waters, from farm dams to feeder drains to main drains to rivers to the estuary basins (Fig. 3). The fact that DON concentrations decreased as the size of the waterbody increased suggests that this comes from terrestrial sources that are gradually diluted downstream (Raymond et al., 2016). This is very different to the eutrophied catchments in temperate latitudes where the vast majority of research is conducted. Nitrate (NO3-) was also a significant portion of the nitrogen pool in a few of the main drains and in the Harvey and Murray rivers.  Figure 5.6: Concentrations of N as DON, NO3- and NH4+ across the hydrologic gradient, from farm dams (‘pond’) to feeder drains, main drains, rivers then the estuary basins, measured in winter 2017. Reporting of nitrogen export from the Peel-Harvey catchment via catchment models primarily focus on total nitrogen (TN, that is, one composite measure of all organic, inorganic, and particulate forms, see Table 2) (Kilminster et al., 2019). This approach is analytically and computationally expedient, but potentially misses key information about ecosystem health. This is because biological organisms use the different nitrogen forms differently (e.g. because NH4+ is more likely to be used than NO3- it may be a stronger driver of eutrophication). The dominance of DON in a highly human-impacted system like the Peel-Harvey contrasts with water quality conditions in comparable systems in temperate regions, where NO3- tends to be the dominant nitrogen form. As a consequence, very little is known about how organisms use DON. More research will clearly be needed on this topic in order to fully understand the downstream impact of this type of nitrogen pollution in the Peel-Harvey system. 5.5.2 ‘What’: Nutrients originating from soils and groundwaters will be difficult to track, but rain provides a distinct inorganic nitrogen source 5.5.2.1 Fertilisers We sent our phosphate fertiliser samples to our collaborator Daren Gooddy at the British Geological Survey for analysis. Unfortunately, we found that the isotope composition of the phosphate fertilisers used in the Peel-Harvey region vary depending on both the fertiliser manufacturer and the year of production (Fig. 4). This means that the source signature of phosphorus isotopes would be too variable to make useful ‘fingerprints’ of agricultural run-off. Figure 5.7: The isotopic composition of PO43- in fertilisers sold to farmers in the Peel-Harvey catchment between 2012 and 2018. Dashed lines show mean values for AGRAS (top) and Superphosphate (bottom). 5.5.2.2 Soils We measured the isotope composition of the different forms of nitrogen found in soils (total nitrogen, TN, ammonium, NH4+, and nitrate, NO3-) on six livestock farms across the Harvey (Farms B, A, F), Murray (Farms D and E), and Serpentine (Farm C) catchments (Fig. 5, and see Fig. 2 for farm locations).  Figure 5.8: Box and whisker plots of the (a) isotope composition of the total soil N pool, (b) 2M KCl extractable NH4+, and (c, d) NO3- pools. Black diamonds indicate outlier values and boxes represent quartiles 1 – 3 around the median (black horizontal line). Note that Farm C has a significantly depleted δ15N-TN composition (a), while Farms A and D have significantly depleted δ15N and δ18O compositions of the extractable inorganic N forms (b, c, d). We found two distinct fingerprints in NO3- isotopes: farms with relatively high δ15N-NO3- and δ18O-NO3- values (B, C, E), and farms with relatively low δ15N-NO3- and δ18O-NO3- values (A, D; Fig. 5c, d). These differences must be driven by fundamental differences in soil biology between the farms, but were not easily explained by factors like soil type, soil moisture content, or current land-use. This was surprising because the farm sites were selected to span a range of soil leaching potential (i.e. sand to clay soils), and we expected to find less processed (i.e. lower) δ15N values in the sandier soils.  Instead, we may potentially be detecting the influence of two other factors. First, a land-use legacy effect on soil nitrogen cycling being reflected in the nitrogen isotopes, creating distinct values between the different farms independent of soil type. For instance, many farms in the region have shifted from dairy (higher stocking rates) to beef (lower stocking rates) over the past few decades. Second, heavy rainfalls during the winter period ensured that even the well-drained soils were saturated, and thus could have hosted the types of microbial reactions that would enrich δ15N values (Table 2). Despite this complexity, the relatively small range of δ15N values in the total nitrogen pool (1.5 – 4.5 ‰, Fig. 5a) provide a reasonable ‘source’ fingerprint for our subsequent work assessing transformation during transport downstream to the estuary.   5.5.2.3 Groundwater At the upstream end of the hydrologic gradient, groundwater in the Peel-Harvey catchment can also contain very high levels of nitrogen (Fig. 6). However, N concentrations (and isotopes) were extremely variable between the different wells, ranging from ~0 µM to ~1,000 µM. A more in-depth study of the groundwater hydrology of the region would be needed to determine why high nitrogen concentrations persist in some locations but not others.  The isotope composition of NO3- in the groundwater ranged from values that are typical for N leached from soil (‘terrestrial’) to values that reflect a clear human input to the groundwater (‘fertiliser’) (Fig. 6b). Despite this variability, our data demonstrate that groundwater can contain high concentrations of all three nitrogen forms, and thus could be a source of N enrichment to the estuary and other surface waters.  Figure 5.9: (a) Variations in the concentrations of the dominant N forms and (b) isotopic composition of NO3-, when present, in groundwater in ten shallow wells (~4 m to water table). Wells were sampled both in the winter (Jul. 2017) and summer (Feb. 2017), but water chemistry did not differ significantly between these sampling dates. 5.5.2.4 Precipitation We were surprised to find such high and variable concentrations of all three nitrogen forms in rain falling in the Peel-Harvey catchment (Fig. 7). These high concentrations are likely caused by a combination of local reactive N off-gassed from soils, combustion, and bush fires and complex chemical reactions in the atmosphere (Jickells et al., 2016).  Figure 5.10: (a) The concentration of different N forms in precipitation and (b) the isotopic composition of NO3- in precipitation that fell in the Peel-Harvey catchment in summer and winter 2017. To give these results context, the grey boxes in (b) show the commonly reported range of NO3- isotopes in NH4NO3 fertilisers and terrestrial soils. While rain NO3- isotope values did vary (e.g. between morning and afternoon showers), the very high values of oxygen isotopes (δ18O) in NO3- from rainwater mean that they provide distinct fingerprints of where and when ‘atmospheric’ nitrogen enters the large surface water bodies of the Peel-Harvey system.  5.5.3 ‘Where’: Shallow, productive waters are nitrogen removal hot-spots In order for N to be ‘removed’ (either converted into gaseous forms or taken up by plants) from the Peel-Harvey microbes will first need to convert the dominant DON into NH4+ (for plant uptake) or NO3- (the first step towards producing N2O and N2 gasses). The knowledge that the zones of greater biological activity will enhance the nitrogen ‘turnover’ reactions thus motivated us to start identifying nitrogen removal hot-spots by looking for areas with the highest concentrations of biologically-produced dissolved gasses.  By far the highest concentrations of dissolved gasses in the drains (including drains and farm dams) around the catchment (Fig. 8). This suggests that the drains are very biologically active, and thus could play a critical role in controlling how much nitrogen reaches the estuary Figure 5.11: A summary of the dissolved gasses produced in different portions of the Peel Harvey catchment, from the main drains (0.9 % of the surface water by area) through the rivers (11% of the surface water by area) to the main estuary basins (87% of the surface water by area). The emissions of three gasses (N2O, CH4, and CO2) were all normalised to their ‘global warming potential’ (GWP), which is reported in Tg C y-1 and based on the assumption that CH4 has 28× the warming potential of CO2 and N2O has 280× the warming potential of CO2 (IPCC, 2013). Summer measurements of nitrogen concentrations and isotopes in the main drains supported this suggestion. The dramatic changes in δ15N signatures over the length of the drains (in the downstream direction) means that biological processes are working to recycle (or potentially remove) the nitrogen loads they’re receiving. Nutrient recycling occurs when nitrogen is converted between multiple forms, including incorporated into the biomass and then re-mineralised into the water column, without leaving the system. Nitrogen removal processes can be distinguished from recycling processes based on, (1) a consistent increase in isotope values as the concentrations decrease, and, (2) parallel increases in the N and O isotopes of NO3-. Here active N recycling and removal was most clearly demonstrated in the Waroona Drain downstream from the Waroona wastewater treatment plant, where NH4+ inputs were rapidly removed (Fig. 9, bottom panel) and converted to NO3- within a few kilometres of entering the drain (Fig. 9, middle panel). More intensive sampling through the middle reaches of the drain should be undertaken to identify the exact rate of conversion to NO3-, as currently this estimate is based on the one site we could access further downstream (Fig. 9). Despite this acknowledged uncertainty, the mirrored patterns of the δ15N composition and composition between the two inorganic N forms (NO3- and NH4+) are highly indicative of biological reactions. Thus, the inclusion of isotope data here enabled us to help rule out alternative explanations for the observed shift in concentrations downstream (e.g. inflowing groundwater).  Figure 5.12: Changes in NO3- (centre, left axis, blue circles) and NH4+ (bottom, left axis, blue circles) in the Waroona Drain as water leaves the wastewater treatment plant (~26 km from the estuary) and approaches the Harvey Estuary. Data is from the summer sampling campaign. Note the very high NH4+ concentrations and low δ15N values (right axis, black crosses) closest to the plant. The isotope ‘source’ signature is almost immediately lost, and over 4 km in the drain, all of the NH4+ has converted to NO3- via microbial reactions. At the opposite end of the hydrologic gradient, we also found evidence that the shallow waters in the estuary basins rapidly consumed all of the inorganic nitrogen exported through the rivers (Fig. 10a). Although NO3- concentrations were high in the rivers due to terrestrial (soil and groundwater) sources, these concentrations dropped to ~0 ug N l-1 near the Dawesville Cut and Mandurah Channel. Examination of the isotope composition of the NO3- that did persist in these portions of the estuary showed that this nitrogen originated from rain, not from the rivers (Fig. 10b). This change in nitrogen source between particularly the Murray River and the western side of Peel Inlet highlights how efficiently the shallow estuary waters consumed and recycled inorganic nitrogen. This general pattern persisted both during and after the high-flow summer ‘flood’ event we sampled. However, inputs of terrestrial nitrogen are likely helping to fuel the high sediment N concentrations (Chris S. Hallett et al., 2019b) and large and persistent green macroalgal communities found in the estuary, particularly the south east corner (F. J. Valesini et al., 2019). Figure 5.13: (a) Concentrations of NO3-, the most mobile nitrogen form, across the estuary and main rivers, measured in March 2017. Warmer colours indicate higher concentrations, and black circles indicate locations where samples were collected. (b) The isotope composition of this NO3- shows that the higher loads carried in the rivers primarily came from soil / terrestrial sources (see Fig. 5), while closer to the ocean, the small amounts of NO3- present came primarily from rain /atmospheric deposition (see Fig. 7). 5.5.4 ‘When’: Both the source and amount of nitrogen reaching the estuary fluctuates seasonally 5.5.4.1 Sources Winter rainfalls produce a distinct ‘drainage season’ in the Peel-Harvey, which also seems to change the sources of new nutrients moving through the system. Additionally, the importance of key nutrient sources varies depending on location in the estuary. This is clearly illustrated by the differences in groundwater inputs (as reflected by measurements of a qualitative tracer, radon, 222Rn, see Wells et al. (2018) for more information) measured between seasons in the Murray and Serpentine rivers and lower Harvey Estuary (Fig. 11). First, the persistently higher concentrations in the Murray suggest that groundwater contributes more to the river flow, and thus likely nutrient levels, in that system. This is an important finding given the high nitrogen concentrations we found in much of the shallow groundwater in the region. The seasonal fluctuations then further suggest that low summer water flows maximise groundwater inputs to the Murray River, but almost completely cut off the lower Serpentine and Harvey Estuary from the groundwater. The potentially very high nitrogen concentrations in this groundwater (section 5.2.3) means that this seasonal switch could have a major impact on how much nitrogen reaches the estuary.  Figure 5.14: Concentrations of 222Rn, a qualitative indicator of groundwater inputs, detected in the surface water in the tidal portions of the Murray and Serpentine Rivers, as well as the Harvey Estuary, in the dry summer period (February 2017) and the wet winter period (July 2017). Higher values indicate a higher relative contribution of groundwater to the surface water body. 5.5.4.2 Processes We also found major seasonal differences the nitrogen isotopes measured in the receiving waters. As demonstrated in section 5.5, the δ15N-NO3- and δ15N-NH4+ values were generally less variable in the winter than the summer. This most likely reflects the fact that colder temperatures and faster flows in the winter limit the biological processes responsible for nitrogen isotope variations.  5.5.5 ‘Why’: Both natural streams and artificial drains remove significant quantities of nitrogen during transport towards the estuary Catchment models currently predict daily TN exported via major rivers and drains into the estuary (Fig. 12), where the flux of N from the catchment to the estuary (Nexport) is approximated as a function of downstream discharge (Q) and the TN concentration measured at the gauging station, i.e.  \\[ N_{export} = Q*N \\] Where Q is in ML d-1 and N is in mg N l-1.  Biological nitrogen removal is termed ‘attenuation’ to specify removal via microbial conversion to inert gasses, e.g., denitrification converting reactive NO3- to inert N2 gas, see Table 2. Evidence that these critical attenuation processes occur non-linearly over space and time means that assuming a direct relationship between N concentrations, flows and catchment nitrogen losses can dramatically underestimate actual N losses from the system (Bernhardt et al., 2017). Including terms for N attenuation therefore produces more sensitive catchment nutrient export models, where changes to N inputs in the system are not masked by changes in biological N removal. We used NO3- isotope samples collected regularly over distance in the Punrak Drain, Peel Main Drain, and upper Serpentine River (Fig. 2) to constrain the proportion of N attenuation occurring as N is transported to and through these systems. Two models were used to calculate attenuation, with the final attenuation coefficient being the range between the two generated values. Based on the findings for Objective 1 (section 3), the first model defined the NO3- ‘source fingerprint’ as nitrified soil N (calculated using theoretical mixing and fractionation ratios and measured δ15N-TN), while the second model defined the NO3- ‘source fingerprint’ as the mean soil δ15N-NO3- and δ18O-NO3- measured across the six sampled farms (Fig. 2).  The difference between these ‘source fingerprints’ and the measured NO3- in the receiving waters was then used to calculate N removal (Fig. 13). This was based on the knowledge that any increase in isotope values relative to the sources must have been caused by biological removal (Hogberg, 1997). Figure 5.15: (a) Estimated daily discharge and (b) N export through two drains (Punrak and Peel Main) and one stream (Upper Serpentine) that run parallel to each other along the northern end of the Peel-Harvey catchment. Estimates are based on gauged flow in each system and monthly measured TN concentrations at the gauging stations in 2017. Rectangles indicate dates for the summer and winter sampling campaigns for N forms and isotopes. Figure 5.16: Plots showing the relative isotopic enrichment of O (y axis) and N (x axis) in NO3- measured in the surface water of two drains (Punrak and Peel Main) and the upper Serpentine River feeding the Peel-Harvey Estuary. Rectangles indicate the isotopic range of known N sources to the system, and the 1:1 line indicates the pattern produced during biological N attenuation. Note differences in the scales between summer and winter plots. Based on this knowledge that biological N removal predictably increases the values of δ15N and δ18O in the residual NO3- pool as the reaction progresses, we calculated net attenuation based on the difference between the δ15N and δ18O values measured within each system and the calculated ‘initial’ concentrations for that NO3- pool, i.e.  \\[ \\begin{align*} \\text{Attenuation} &amp;= 1-e^{(\\delta-\\delta_{0})/\\epsilon} \\\\ Atten_{total} &amp;= \\int_{0}^{x} \\frac{d[\\text{Attenuation}]}{dx} \\ \\end{align*} \\] Where δ is the measured δ15N-NO3- or δ18O-NO3- value at a given location, δ0 is the established ‘source’ value for that isotope (using either model 1 or model 2), and ε is the known degree of isotopic enrichment caused by N removal. The top equation generates the proportion of the initial N pool attenuated, which is then calculated for each location along the stream and integrated over stream length (x) to generate the proportion of the total N load attenuated (Attentotal). For more details on this equation and approach, see (Wells et al., 2019, 2016). The generated Attentotal value was then folded into the established catchment Nexport model (Huang et al., 2019a; Kilminster et al., 2019) to better capture Nexport differences driven by biology vs hydrology, i.e.  \\[ N_{total} = N_{export} + Atten_{total} N_{export} \\] Using this approach, we found that N attenuation was consistently lower in the Peel Main Drain than in either Punrak or Serpentine, and that attenuation in all three systems was lower in the winter than the summer (Fig. 14). This latter finding is to be expected given the lower temperatures and faster flows, and provides a ‘first-principles’ validation of the method. However, the situation in the Peel Main Drain is a bit more puzzling, in that N concentrations are consistently very high, but attenuation very low. This could be due to either the relatively fast flows in that drain, where vegetation etc are frequently removed, meaning that N-removing organisms don’t have enough time to take up the available N.  Figure 5.17: Daily N exported to the Peel-Harvey via the upper Serpentine River (top), Punrak Drain (middle), and Peel Main Drain (bottom), calculated from logged stream flow and modelled TN concentrations (coloured lines and symbols) and accounting for biological attenuation during transport (black areas, which cover the range of calculated values). Grey background indicates winter months (high flow). Question marks on %Attenuation are due to lack of measurable NO3- in the surface water. This data set also reveals one of the major limitations to quantifying N removal: we can only measure removal when nitrate is present. So, in the summer Peel Main Drain, where nitrate concentrations are consistently too low to measure, we are unable to assess whether these low concentrations are due to high removal rates or low inputs. The fact that ‘nil’ reactive N concentrations are recorded can thus indicate either a healthy waterway (no excess nutrient inputs) or a highly reactive yet polluted waterway (excess nutrient inputs drive rapid nitrogen removal). This poses a significant challenge to water quality monitoring, which requires robust reactive-transport models to resolve (Huang et al., 2019b).  5.6 Conclusions Our work to-date in the Peel-Harvey system has produced three critical take-home messages: The improved understanding of the source and form of nitrogen moving through the Peel-Harvey system will underpin on-going work to quantify human and climatic effects on water quality. Our findings that two rivers (Murray and Harvey) carried high loads of NO3-, which is indicative of human impacts exceeding the ecosystem’s capacity to absorb nutrients, suggests that remediation activities should target these two systems. At the same time, our work highlights the need to better understand how reactive the very large DON pool is, and whether this reactivity varies between catchment locations. Are human activities increasing its concentration or altering its chemistry? Such changes would have knock-on effects to the nitrogen recycling and removal dynamics we uncovered here. There is a need for greater research and management efforts to target the drains and farm dams across the Peel-Harvey system, given the evidence for the potentially high biological productivity and N attenuation occurring in these often-overlooked features Future work should focus on identifying the characteristics of these small waterways that maximise the N attenuation capacity that we have demonstrated they could achieve, to help reduce nutrient inflows into the estuary. For instance, it is clear from our study that Punrak Drain removes more N than Peel Main Drain or the Serpentine River, but the precise features of the drain that drive this are not clear. Further investigation into the relationships between N attenuation and drain features such as morphology, groundwater inputs, flow rates, and vegetations is warranted to help mitigate nutrient pollution of the receiving waters.  Accurately assessing nutrient pollution and impacts in a eutrophied system like the Peel-Harvey requires a nuanced approach The detailed assessments of nitrogen turnover in the shallow drains and estuary also highlight a major limitation to our current ability to track this pollutant. Namely, how can we distinguish zones where inorganic nitrogen concentrations are zero due to eutrophication (e.g. overgrowth of macrophytes in the Peel Estuary) vs zones where inorganic nitrogen concentrations are zero due to a lack of pollution? We need to develop multi-proxy systems for determining the extent of nitrogen pollution that are able to identify both zones like the Peel Estuary, which both receives and retains high inorganic nitrogen loads (low concentrations in the water), and the Murray River, which receives and exports high inorganic nitrogen loads (high concentrations in the water).  5.7 Acknowledgements Thanks to Natasha Carlson-Perret, Iain Alexander, Matheus Carvahlo de Carvahlo, and Hanieh Tohidi Farid for assistance processing samples in the Centre for Coastal Biogeochemistry laboratories.

Its rivers drain extensively cleared catchments and have long brought large quantities of organic matter, fine sediments (mud) and dissolved nutrients, including nitrogen and phosphorus, into the system. These inputs impact the condition or health of the estuarine sediments, including their particle size and porosity, oxygen content and nutrient processing abilities. In turn, these changes can degrade water quality, impact biota that live on or in the sediments, and subsequently, lead to a host of diminished societal benefits from the estuary. The enrichment and resulting health of the sediments in the Peel-Harvey have long been of interest, with the first intensive surveys conducted in the 1970s and highlighting high levels of organic matter, nitrogen and phosphorus throughout large parts of the basins. More recently, concern has been growing over the extent and impacts of fine sulfidic sediments, or so-called monosulfidic black oozes. Despite these concerns, two decades have passed since the last broad-scale survey of sediments in the estuary, and the condition of sediments in the estuary’s rivers, in particular, has been poorly documented. This study aims to address these gaps in our current understanding of sediments throughout the estuary, and particularly to assess the impacts of enrichment on the health of its sediments. Specifically, we describe and test a novel approach (a ‘Rapid Assessment Protocol’ or RAP) for quickly and cost-effectively scoring sediment condition based on its colour, texture and odour, which could be used for future monitoring of sediment health in this system. The accuracy of the RAP was verified by comparing it to various detailed sediment enrichment attributes that we measured from samples collected across the estuary basins and rivers. This report provides a broad summary of our key findings, and is supplemented by a more detailed and technical account in Chris S. Hallett et al. (2019b) . Our findings show that the RAP provides an excellent measure of sediment enrichment and its broader effects on sediment condition throughout the Peel-Harvey, with a particularly high success rate (&gt;88%) of identifying ‘good’ sites with low enrichment. Sediments throughout large parts of the system are moderately to highly enriched with carbon and nitrogen, particularly in the deeper, muddier waters of the Harvey Estuary, which negatively impacts their condition. Sites with low levels of enrichment were typically coarse-grained, well oxygenated sands with little to no odour of hydrogen sulfide, and were mainly found in the shallower, nearshore waters of the basins and the middle to lower reaches of the rivers. In contrast, highly enriched, poor condition sediments were typically oozy, grey/black muds with little to no oxygenated layer and a moderate to strong hydrogen sulfide odour. The unhealthiest sediments (monosulfidic black oozes) were found in the Yunderup Channel, the southeast corner of Peel Inlet and the upper estuarine reaches of the Serpentine and Murray rivers. More detailed investigations of the sediments in navigation channels and other depositional areas in the estuary, using the RAP described here, are recommended to better understand flow-on effects for broader estuary health. To better assess the ongoing health of sediments throughout the estuary, and how activities such as dredging may impact sediment and broader estuarine health, we recommend that a consistent and regular sediment monitoring program is implemented alongside other environmental monitoring of the estuary. The RAP that we have developed, with its simple scoring system and predictive framework for classifying the sediment condition of any new site, provides a cost-effective tool for such monitoring. 6.2 Background The enrichment of sediments with nutrients and organic matter is a key stressor of the health of the Peel-Harvey Estuary, as is the case for many eutrophic estuaries throughout the world. This predominantly reflects the extensively cleared river catchments that drain into the estuary, bringing large inputs of organic matter, fine sediments (mud) and dissolved inorganic nutrients including nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from surrounding agricultural and urban areas (Kelsey et al., 2011; McComb and Humphries, 1992). The resulting enrichment can impact the condition of sediments, their biogeochemistry and nutrient cycling processes (Fig. 1, Burdige, 2011), and thereby the ecology and ecosystem services they support (Hale et al., 2016). Organic matter is decomposed by microbes in the sediment, increasing sediment oxygen demand and creating hypoxic (low oxygen) or anoxic (no oxygen) conditions. Enriched, hypoxic sediments typically act as sources of inorganic nutrients such as phosphates and ammonium to the water column, potentially stimulating harmful algal blooms (Conley et al., 2007). They can also accumulate toxic hydrogen sulfide, leading to impoverished benthic faunal communities living in or on the sediment (Kanaya et al., 2016). At the extreme end of the enrichment continuum are anoxic, organic-rich muds known as monosulfidic black oozes (MBO), which occur in parts of the Peel-Harvey Estuary (Kraal et al., 2013a). These sediments can be a significant source of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, and may have significant negative ecological impacts when disturbed (Sullivan et al., 2002). A key challenge for estuary managers and scientists, which this study aimed to tackle, is how to quantify and monitor sediment condition throughout the Peel-Harvey in a timely and cost-effective manner. Intensive studies in the late 1970s to late 1980s revealed high concentrations of P, N and organic matter in surface sediments of the Peel-Harvey (Gabrielson, 1980; McComb et al., 1998). Contrary to expectations, a subsequent study in 1998 following the opening of the Dawesville Cut found little change in sediment nutrient or organic matter concentrations from pre- to post-Cut periods. More recently, concern has also been growing over the extent and potential impacts of fine sulfidic sediments (MBOs) in the estuary, and particularly around the consequences of dredging these muds during maintenance operations (F. Valesini et al., 2019). Despite these concerns, it has been almost two decades since the last broad-scale survey of sediment condition and biogeochemistry throughout the estuary. Most previous studies have also focused on the estuary’s basins, with only limited surveys in the rivers. Our study sought to address these knowledge gaps by developing and validating a rapid and cost-effective approach for measuring sediment condition that could support a future monitoring plan. We undertook a broad-scale survey of sediments at almost 100 sites throughout the estuary basins and rivers in November-December 2016. We collected (i) scored data on sediment colour, texture and odour; (ii) quantitative measurements of sediment enrichment (total carbon, TC; organic carbon, OC; total nitrogen, TN) and grain size, and (iii) C and N isotopes, to better understand how human activities may have impacted the estuary via chronic or acute enrichment. This sediment data also provided key ‘base layers’ for the estuary biogeochemical model developed in other parts of the Linkage Project (see Huang et al., 2019b). The specific study objectives were as follows. 6.3 Objectives Develop and apply a simple and rapid approach (a Rapid Assessment Protocol; RAP) for characterizing sediment condition, based on scores for sediment colour, odour and texture, throughout the Peel-Harvey Estuary. Evaluate whether the RAP condition scores reliably reflect the extent of sediment enrichment, as determined by complementary, detailed measurements of TC, OC and TN throughout the estuary. Quantify the influence of water depth, %mud and enrichment on sediment condition, and summarise these relationships via spatially interpolated maps. Use complementary sediment isotope data to identify zones of chronic vs. acute nutrient enrichment. Figure 6.1: Core with oxygenated sediment (grey/ brown) and anoxic sediment (black) (Photo, C. Hallett). Figure 6.2: Conceptual model of the effects of progressive enrichment with organic matter (OM) and nutrients on sediment condition and biogeochemistry (from Hallett et al., 2019). Increasing enrichment leads to declining sediment condition, including a shift from (a) oxic to (c) anoxic conditions. This disrupts nutrient cycling between the sediment and overlying water and leads to the accumulation and potential release of inorganic nutrients (ammonium, phosphates) and toxic sulfides. (aRPD – apparent Redox Potential Discontinuity, which reflects depth of oxygen penetration into the sediment). 6.4 Approach 6.5 Rapid Assessment Protocol for evaluating sediment condition 6.5.0.1 Sample collection A wide-scale sediment collection program was undertaken across 97 sites throughout the estuary during November-December 2016, comprising 62 sites in the basins (Peel Inlet and Harvey Estuary) and 35 sites across the estuarine reaches of the Serpentine and Murray rivers (Fig. 2). At each site, two replicate, intact sediment cores were collected using a corer with a detachable, transparent PVC tube (600 mm long and 60 mm in diameter). The intact cores were then briefly stored in the dark until processed as described below. Water depth (m) was also recorded at each site. 6.5.0.2 Rapid assessment of sediment condition characteristics A rapid, semi-quantitative assessment of sediment condition was undertaken on each replicate core, based on sediment colour, texture and odour. Each of these characteristics was scored from 0–5 (Table 1), reflecting poor to good sediment condition as outlined in Fig. 1. The scores for these three RAP variables were then summed to provide a total RAP score (0–15) for each core. Scores for replicate cores were then averaged to generate site-level RAP scores for data analysis. Further details on the RAP approach and all of the following analyses can be found in Hallett et al. (2019). 6.5.0.3 Quantitative assessment of sediment enrichment and other parameters In the field, pooled subsamples of sediment were collected from each pair of replicate cores and stored at −18 °C prior to subsequent analysis. Sediments within 2 cm of the sediment surface were analysed for %TC, %OC, %TN and stable isotopes of nitrogen (δ15N) and carbon (δ15C) using an isotope ratio mass spectrometer, and those within 5 cm of the surface were analysed for particle size composition using a hydrometer. For particle size, the masses of each sample comprised of gravel (&gt;2 mm), sand (50 µm–2 mm), silt (2–50 µm) and clay (&lt;2 µm) were expressed as percentages, then the silt and clay fractions were combined to produce a measure of the fine sediments at each site (%mud). Full details of the laboratory analyses are provided in Hallett et al. (2019). For details on the isotope analyses see Smith et al. (2016). Figure 6.3: Map of the sites at which sediments were sampled in the Peel-Harvey Estuary in 2016. 6.5.0.4 Data analyses The following briefly summarises the intent of the main statistical analyses of the sediment data. Chris S. Hallett et al. (2019b) describes in detail all data pretreatments, statistical routines employed, test designs and routine settings. Most data analyses were undertaken in the Primer v7 multivariate software (Clarke and Gorley, 2015) with the PERMANOVA+ add-on module (Gorley and Clarke, 2008). Spatial mapping of sediment parameters and RAP results throughout the estuary were undertaken in QGIS 2.18. Guides for interpreting the main outcomes of these analyses are provided in the ‘Main Findings’ section. All sites were firstly statistically classified into sediment enrichment classes (Low, Medium, High) based on their %TC, %OC and %TN measurements. The extent to which the RAP scores (collated from sediment colour, texture and odour) differentiated among sites assigned to the three enrichment classes was then tested. As these tests showed an excellent alignment between sediment enrichment and RAP condition, all sites were then classified into sediment condition classes (Good, Fair, Poor). To broaden the usefulness of the RAP approach beyond the current study, easy-to-use ‘decision trees’ were developed for predicting the condition class of any new site in this system based solely on its RAP scores for colour, texture and/or odour. Separate analyses were undertaken for river and basin sites to account for natural regional variation in sediment colour, texture and odour. Finally, the influences of water depth, %mud and enrichment on sediment condition were quantified, and summarised using spatially interpolated maps. 6.6 Main Findings 6.6.1 Evaluating the Rapid Assessment Protocol for sediment condition The RAP is an accurate and cost-effective measure of sediment enrichment and its broader effects on sediment condition Sites throughout the estuary differed widely in their sediment enrichment (organic matter and nutrients) and mud contents. Sediment TC, most of which comprised OC (a proxy for organic matter), ranged from 0.07-7.85%, whilst TN ranged from 0.01-0.90%. The mud content of sediments ranged from 1-86%, with a mean of ~29%. Statistical clustering of these enrichment measurements at the 97 sites surveyed (see Chris S. Hallett et al., 2019b) resulted in three, highly distinct groups of sites representing Low enrichment (59 sites), Medium enrichment (34 sites) and High enrichment (4 sites) classes. Sites in the High enrichment class had enrichment levels 10–15 times higher than those of the Low class (based on median values for TN, TC and OC; Fig. 3). Figure 6.4: . Box and whisker plots of %TN, %TC and %OC values across all Low, Medium and High enrichment sites throughout the Peel-Harvey Estuary. Horizontal lines in each box represent median values, and whisker endpoints are high/low extreme values. With respect to the sediment attributes that were scored using the RAP, very clear differences in colour, texture and odour were observed among sites (Fig. 4). Based on their scores across these three attributes, 35, 25 and two sites of the 62 surveyed across the basins were classed as in Good, Fair and Poor condition, respectively. Among riverine sites, 27 were in Good condition, six were Fair and two were Poor. The patterns in RAP scores among these condition classes differed slightly between basin and river sites. In the basins, colour and texture scores declined consistently from Good (median scores of 4) to Poor (median scores of 0), as did total RAP scores (Fig. 5a). In contrast, riverine sites in Fair and Poor condition showed similarly low colour and texture scores (median ≤1) and total RAP scores (Fig. 5b). Low odour scores were largely restricted to basin and river sites in Poor condition (medians of 1.5 and 1, respectively). Figure 6.5: Cores of sediments classified as (a) Good, (b) Fair and (c) Poor condition based on their Rapid Assessment Protocol (RAP) scores for sediment colour, texture and odour. Figure 6.6: Box and whisker plots of sediment colour, texture, odour and total Rapid Assessment Protocol (RAP) scores among sites classified as being in Good, Fair and Poor sediment condition, across (a) basins and (b) rivers. Horizontal lines in each box represent median values, and whisker endpoints are high/low extreme values. The RAP was shown to provide a highly useful proxy for assessing the degree of sediment enrichment and its broader effects on sediment condition throughout the estuary. A summary of the statistical method used to test this relationship is shown in Fig. 6, with the key outcomes of the test (known as ‘Canonical Analysis of Principal Coordinates’, or CAP) as follows. A guide for interpreting the CAP plot is given below, and further details are in Chris S. Hallett et al. (2019b). There was a strong association between the RAP scores of sediment condition and the quantitative enrichment classes (low, medium and high), i.e. correlations of 0.62–0.78. Sites grading from low through to high enrichment were best explained by differences in sediment texture (grading from grainy sands to oozy muds) and colour (grading from yellow/brown to black), with high enrichment sites also being particularly linked with strong odours. RAP scores differed significantly among the enrichment classes, and correctly identified the right enrichment class for sites ~84% of the time. The RAP was particularly successful (&lt;12% misclassification rate) at identifying sites with low enrichment, demonstrating its promise as a first-pass survey approach for identifying ‘least impacted’ reference or control sites to support future impact assessments. Broadly, to interpret the CAP plot in Fig. 6: (1) the points on the plot represent the survey sites, which are each colour-coded by their enrichment class (low, medium and high) and labelled with their condition class (black labels; good, fair and poor) – simply, sites lying close together on the plot have more similar condition and enrichment characteristics than those further apart; (2) site differences in sediment condition and enrichment were well ‘explained’ by two main gradients – the horizontal axis (CAP1) and vertical axis (CAP2). The blue lines (vectors) overlaid on the plot show the roles played by each of the RAP characteristics in helping to explain those site differences. Thus, sites grading from low to high enrichment (and good to poor condition) from left to right along CAP1 were associated strongly with decreasing RAP scores for sediment texture and colour (i.e. vector lines lying mainly parallel to CAP1) and to a lesser extent odour (vector line at a sharper angle to CAP1). Moving from the bottom to the top along CAP2, the greatest separation of sites was seen for those in the high enrichment class. The RAP vector most strongly linked with this separation was odour, reflecting stronger smelling sediments in the high enrichment class. Figure 6.7: Canonical Analysis of Principal Coordinates (CAP) plot, with the 97 sites coded by symbols for their enrichment class and labelled with their Rapid Assessment Protocol (RAP) condition class (G–Good, F–Fair, P–Poor). Note that several sites overlap on the plot. Vector lines (in blue) overlaid on the plot indicate the strength and direction of the correlations between each RAP variable (colour, texture and odour) with the CAP axes. The RAP can predict the sediment condition of any new site Given the above validation that the RAP accurately reflects sediment enrichment and broader sediment condition, easy-to-use decision trees were then generated to enable any investigator to reliably predict the sediment condition class of any further basin or river site in the Peel-Harvey based solely on its observed RAP scores. These decision trees (produced statistically by a regression tree approach, see Chris S. Hallett et al., 2019b) are shown in Fig. 7 below. To use these trees, the RAP scores of any new sediment sample are simply compared to the thresholds at each branch of the tree, starting at the top, then taking a left path if the non-bracketed criteria are true, or a right path if the bracketed criteria are true.  Figure 6.8: Decision trees for assigning new (a) basin and (b) river sites in the Peel-Harvey Estuary to their appropriate sediment condition class (bold text at terminal nodes) based on their Rapid Assessment Protocol (RAP) score thresholds. Unbracketed and bracketed thresholds at each branch indicate that a left and right path, respectively, should be followed through the tree. (Trees were constructed using LINKTREE and SIMPROF routines. B% reflects the extent of class differences). The decision tree for basin sites indicated that Poor sediment condition would be predicted for any future site with odour scores of ≤2 (i.e. moderate to strong smell of hydrogen sulphide, or ‘rotten egg gas’; Table 1), or colour or texture scores of 0 (black oozy muds; Table 1, Fig. 7a). Separation of basin sites with Fair or Good sediment condition mainly depends on whether their texture score was ≤2 or ≥3, respectively (i.e. smooth to oozy muds vs. grainy sands). Among river sites, Good sediment condition would be predicted for those with texture scores of ≥2 and colour scores of ≥1.5, and Poor condition for sites with odour scores of ≤2 or texture scores of &lt;1 (Fig. 7b). These decision rules were used to determine the condition of sediments at a further 120 sites throughout the Peel-Harvey in 2017–18, to help quantify the ecological responses of benthic macroinvertebrate communities to sediment stressors and subsequently establish a new biological index of estuarine condition (Cronin-O’Reilly et al., 2019). Given the speed and low resource costs of applying the RAP decision rules, they could clearly provide a robust, consistent and cost-effective approach for future monitoring of sediment condition throughout the Peel-Harvey (see section 6). Sediments in the deeper parts of the Harvey Estuary are generally muddier, more enriched and in poorer condition than those in the Peel Inlet In general, the least enriched sediments were located around the edges of the estuary basins, and particularly in the well-flushed western Peel Inlet and northern-most Harvey Estuary, whereas the more central parts of the basins tended to be more enriched (Fig. 8). Harvey Estuary sediments were notably more enriched than those in Peel Inlet, although the south-eastern corner of Peel Inlet was also a hotspot of enrichment. Much of the sediment in the rivers was moderately to highly enriched, with the highest levels typically seen among sites further upstream. These patterns in enrichment were generally mirrored by those in sediment condition, with more enriched sites often exhibiting poorer condition. Spatial interpolations of water depth, sediment mud content and enrichment parameters help to illuminate the effects of both natural and human influences on patterns in sediment condition throughout the estuary. Deeper, central parts of the estuary basins generally exhibited Fair sediment condition, in contrast to the Good condition of many sites on the shallower margins (Fig. 9a). This generally reflected higher mud contents at the deeper basin sites, but particularly at those in the Harvey Estuary (&gt;60% mud; Fig. 9b), where levels of enrichment were notably higher (Fig. 9c, d). These patterns were confirmed by statistical tests (distance-based linear modelling), which revealed that enrichment alone explained the largest proportion of the variability in RAP scores (57% among basin sites and 52% among river sites; Appendix 1). Enrichment was significantly associated with poorer sediment condition among river and basin sites, irrespective of their mud content. Nonetheless, enriched sediments were particularly likely to exhibit poorer condition if they were also muddier, which in the case of basin sites was associated with greater water depths. These relationships reflect the clear effects of enrichment, and associated muddying, on the physical and biogeochemical characteristics, and therefore condition, of sediments. Accumulation of OM and nutrients, often in conjunction with increased fine particles (mud), alters the physical and biogeochemical properties of sediments, including their porosity, oxygenation status and nutrient cycling processes (Fig. 1, Eyre and Ferguson, 2009; Valdemarsen et al., 2010). These changes manifest as changes in sediment texture, colour and odour (Hargrave et al., 2008; Rosenberg et al., 2001), which the RAP summarises via a semi-quantitative scoring system. Figure 6.9: Map of overall sediment enrichment (TC, OC and TN) interpolated throughout the estuary. Circles denote sediment sampling sites, colour coded by their sediment condition class (green, Good; yellow, Fair; red, Poor). Insets provide higher resolution views of patterns in the rivers. Figure 6.10: Maps of (a) water depth, (b) %mud, (c) %OC, (d) %TN interpolated throughout the estuary. Circles denote sediment sampling sites, colour coded by their sediment condition class (green, Good; yellow, Fair; red, Poor). Insets provide higher resolution views of patterns in the rivers. The proportion of mud, which varies naturally with water depth, influences sediment enrichment as nutrients and OM bind to fine sediment particles. Deeper waters tend to harbour muddier and therefore more enriched sediments, which impacts their sediment condition. This is particularly true in the Peel-Harvey, which experiences naturally low levels of tidal flushing due to the estuary’s narrow connections to the microtidal marine environment, and also declining freshwater flows under a drying climate which are reducing the degree of riverine flushing and leading to increased stratification and retention (Hallett et al., 2018; F. Valesini et al., 2019). The finding of muddier, enriched sediments in the deeper waters of the Harvey Estuary matches patterns observed during historical sediment surveys in 1978–89 (McComb et al., 1998). The intensively fertilized Harvey catchment, with its particularly high density of artificial drains and sandy sediments with low nutrient binding capacity, has delivered large quantities of inorganic nutrients to the estuary over many decades (McComb and Humphries, 1992). Also, significant freshwater flows from the upper Harvey River have been artificially diverted to the ocean since the 1930s, contributing to the Harvey Estuary experiencing far less flushing than the Peel Inlet, which receives flows from the Serpentine and much larger Murray rivers. As a result, fine sediments, nutrients and OM from the Harvey catchment have tended to accumulate in its basin to a greater degree, with evident impacts on sediment enrichment and condition. This outcome has potentially important implications for the future management of water resources and downstream impacts in the Harvey Estuary, particularly under a drying climate that will see further reductions in flushing river flows (Hallett et al., 2018). The poorest sediment condition was observed in navigation channels and other areas of high deposition, including upper parts of the Serpentine and Murray rivers The poorest sediment condition in the Peel-Harvey Estuary occurred at highly depositional sites characterised by both high enrichment and mud content. These included the upper Serpentine and Murray rivers, the southeast corner of the Peel Inlet and the artificially deepened Yunderup Channel (Figs 8, 9). Flushing is minimal in the latter locations and thick macroalgal mats are known to accumulate and rapidly become buried below layers of fine sediment (Morgan et al., 2012). Previously, intensive studies of these channel sites have revealed strongly reducing (i.e. anoxic), monosulfidic sediments that can release ammonium and phosphates into the water column (Kraal et al., 2013b). These findings have significant implications given the forecast expansion of marina developments and boating channels within the Peel-Harvey in coming decades, and particularly the proposed dredging of a new, large channel to support a major marina development at Point Grey, opposite the Dawesville Channel. The RAP could be employed for spatially extensive, yet rapid and cost-effective surveys of navigation channels and other highly depositional areas throughout the estuary, to quantify the extent of these highly degraded sediments and help better inform future dredging activities. 6.6.2 Identifying zones of chronic vs acute nutrient enrichment via sediment isotopes Stable isotopes highlighted hotspots of nitrogen enrichment We measured the isotope composition of the organic matter in the sediments (δ15N and δ13C) to get a better understanding of the sources and processes driving the observed sediment quality patterns. Based on the knowledge that sediment δ15N values will increase (become more positive) when there are higher rates of biological nitrogen removal relative to production, we identified two distinct ‘nitrogen removal zones’ (Fig. 10a). These were near the Mandurah Channel and along the western shore of the Harvey Estuary, and correspond to zones of particularly low TN concentrations (Fig. 9). The sediment nitrogen data thus confirms that the most eutrophied sediment region, which also corresponds to a region of high macrophyte abundance (see F. J. Valesini et al., 2019), is still accumulating nitrogen. In contrast, the suspected excess nitrogen inputs from storm drains around Mandurah and septic leaks along the Harvey Estuary shore seem to be driving nitrogen removal from the sediments (hence low concentrations and high δ15N signatures in these locations). Sediment d13C data also brings a new dimension to the sediment quality distribution established above, by revealing that the high C content of the estuary sediments comes from decomposition of the abundant macrophyte beds (F. J. Valesini et al., 2019), rather than export and accumulation of terrestrial C (Fig. 10b). Together these findings add some nuance to the sediment quality index, by demonstrating that, 1) some ‘healthy’ sediment zones may still be affected by human pollutants, and, 2) internal organic matter production is driving the observed declining sediment quality. Figure 6.11: (a) Map of sediment nitrogen stable isotope values (δ15N) and carbon (δ13C) interpolated throughout the estuary. These values were measured on the total nitrogen (TN) and organic carbon (OC) pools, as reported in Fig. 9. Circles denote sediment sampling sites. 6.7 Conclusions Sediments in the Peel-Harvey are enriched with nutrients and organic matter Despite the intended aim of the Dawesville Channel to reduce nutrients in the Peel-Harvey Estuary, sediments throughout large parts of the system remain enriched with carbon and nitrogen, particularly in the deeper, muddier waters of the Harvey Estuary. Stable isotopes highlighted likely point sources of acute nitrogen pollution around the estuary, including along the western edge of Harvey Estuary and along the Murray River. Using this type of isotope approach to evaluate estuary sediment quality is relatively new (an adaption of soil quality assessment techniques). We plan further work to calibrate its sensitivity to human disturbances by measuring changes in sediment δ15N before, during and after dredging in the estuary. Enrichment negatively impacts the condition of sediments in the Peel-Harvey. Degraded sediment condition is likely to impact on the organisms inhabiting the sediment, the water quality in the estuary, and key ecosystem services such as nutrient cycling. Sediments in the poorest condition (monosulfidic black oozes) occur in areas of the estuary with high rates of deposition, including the Yunderup Channel and upper estuarine reaches of the Serpentine and Murray rivers. Further investigations of navigation channels and other depositional areas throughout the estuary, employing the RAP described here, are recommended to quantify the extent and consequences of these highly degraded sediments. The RAP provides a rapid and cost-effective tool for current and future monitoring of sediment condition The RAP is a robust measure of the degree of sediment enrichment and its broader effects on sediment condition. RAP scores correctly identified the enrichment class of 84% of survey sites. The RAP is particularly good at identifying sites with low enrichment, highlighting its potential as a first-pass survey approach for identifying ‘least impacted’ reference sites to support future impact assessments in the Peel-Harvey Estuary. The outputs from the RAP assessment and accompanying quantitative analyses are being used to quantify sediment stressors throughout the system, which in turn provides a framework to assess the ecological responses of benthic macroinvertebrate communities and subsequently establish a biotic index of estuarine condition (Cronin-O’Reilly et al., 2019). The RAP has broad applicability for supporting cost-effective monitoring of sediment condition, given its simple scoring system based on well-documented responses of sediment condition to enrichment, and accompanying ‘decision tree’ for classifying the condition of any new site. In particular, we recommend the RAP be employed for spatially extensive surveys of navigation channels and other highly depositional areas throughout the estuary, to quantify the extent of these highly degraded sediments and better inform future dredging activities. A broad program for future monitoring of sediment condition throughout the Peel-Harvey is proposed in Table 2 and Fig. 11. This program is purposely broad, the finer details for implementing the program needing to be determined depending on the level of interest in uptake and resourcing. Figure 6.12: Map of suggested sites for future monitoring of sediment condition throughout the estuary, based on the outcomes of the current study. Colours indicate sediment condition class, as assessed in the 2016 survey (green, Good; yellow, Fair; red, Poor). Red ellipses denote ‘watch’ areas, i.e. those deemed at greatest risk of impacted sediment condition, and which are particularly likely to require ongoing monitoring and management. Note that the location of all sites is provisional, and should be tailored for purpose prior to finalising any monitoring regime. 6.8 Acknowledgements We are very grateful to Marta Sánchez-Alarcón, Helen Nice, Frances D’Souza and particularly Alan Cottingham for assistance with fieldwork; Graham Lancaster, Iain Alexander, Natasha Carlson-Perret and colleagues at the Environmental Analysis Laboratory and the Centre for Coastal Biogeochemistry Research, Southern Cross University, for laboratory processing of sediment samples, and Malcolm Robb for helpful discussions and advice.

Over more recent history, the macrophytes of the Peel-Harvey, and especially the green macroalgae, have been a major focus due to the massive blooms that occurred from the 1960s–1980s and the ecological and societal issues that resulted. Opening of the Dawesville Cut in 1994 to help alleviate these problems led to a major step change in the estuary’s hydrology and nutrient levels. There have also been other more gradual shifts in the estuarine environment from catchment development and climate change effects, particularly in recent decades. This report explores how the macrophyte community in the Peel-Harvey has changed over the last 40 years (1978–2018), and the environmental drivers that have been most influential. While other studies have examined changes in these plant communities in particular periods (e.g. just before and after the Cut), this is the first to examine the full sampling record. We also developed an index of macrophyte community condition or ‘health’, which was translated into a report card scale from ‘A’ (excellent) to ‘E’ (very poor), and used it to track changes over time across the estuary. Lastly, we propose a macrophyte monitoring plan for the future. This report provides a broad summary of our key findings, and is supplemented by a more detailed and technical account in Krumholz (2019). Our findings show there have been dramatic changes in the macrophyte community from the late 1970s, which in most regions of the estuary has reflected major declines in green macroalgae and increases in seagrass. These shifts were most obvious just after the Cut and the subsequent boost in tidal flushing. The most recent survey results (2017–2018) show that, for the first time in the monitoring record, the community is clearly dominated by seagrass (70% of overall biomass in autumn 2018) as opposed to green macroalgae (52–86% of overall biomass from 1978–1994). This progression has led to improved health of the macrophyte community, from very poor to fair (index grade E–C) across much of the estuary in 1985–1989, to fair to excellent (grade C–A) in 2018. Figure 7.1: Green macroalage in the southern Harvey Estuary (Photo, O. Krumholz). One region of the estuary that is not showing signs of improvement is the southern Harvey Estuary. The macrophytes in this shallow and poorly flushed region remain in poor condition and are showing worrying signs with respect to increases in nuisance green macroalgae. While average green algal biomass decreased from the late 1970s to just after the Cut in this region, it has increased in more recent years, especially in spring when it far exceeds values recorded for any other macrophyte group across the whole estuary in the full 40 year timeframe. The shallow south-eastern Peel Inlet also has a high biomass of green macroalgae, again especially in spring, which has largely persisted throughout the monitoring record and even increased in recent years. The main environmental driver of the above longer-term shifts in the macrophyte community was the concentration of total nitrogen in the water column. Green algal-dominated assemblages were generally linked with higher nitrogen concentrations, and more seagrass-dominated assemblages were linked with lower concentrations. Some weaker correlations were also found with increasing salinities and temperatures, as well as decreasing total phosphorus concentrations. A more detailed study of the macrophytes across the estuary in spring 2017 and autumn 2018 found 23 species in total (over a third of which were red macroalgae), which has increased from the last comparable survey in 2009 (14 species in spring 2009 vs 18 species in spring 2017). Based on biomass, seagrass clearly dominates the 2017–2018 community (56% on average), most of which is Ruppia sp. and occurs mainly in the northern Harvey Estuary and parts of Peel Inlet. Not only has the seagrass contribution increased since spring 2009 (38% vs 60% in spring 2017), but the dominant seagrass species has changed from Zostera sp. to Ruppia sp. As for the long-term macrophyte data, the changes in the 2017–2018 community from more seagrass-dominated assemblages in the northern half of the system to a more green algal-dominated one in the southern Harvey Estuary, were best linked with an increase in total nitrogen, and to a lesser extent total phosphorus. To better assess the ongoing health and environmental drivers of this macrophyte community, and if its recent move towards seagrass domination reflects a stable shift, it is imperative that a consistent and regular macrophyte monitoring program is implemented, alongside other environmental monitoring of the estuary. The broad monitoring regime we have proposed can be tailored to suit resourcing. 7.2 Background Macroalgal and seagrass communities are one of the most visual elements of the Peel-Harvey biota. These submerged plant communities (collectively referred to as ‘macrophytes’) play pivotal roles in estuarine ecosystems and are key indicators of environmental condition. Healthy macrophyte communities provide many ecosystem services, including supporting functions such as primary production and carbon sequestration, provisioning functions such as food and habitat for many fauna, and regulating functions such as sediment and shoreline stabilisation. These, in turn, support many societal values such as productive fisheries, wildlife watching opportunities and safer coastal environments that better mitigate threats such as bank erosion and flooding. Macrophytes are also good indicators of water quality, reflecting key aspects such as nutrient availability, salinity and turbidity. Seagrass-dominated communities, as opposed to those which are algal-dominated (and particularly by fast-growing green algae), typically reflect healthier estuarine ecosystems (e.g. Macreadie et al., 2017). The Peel-Harvey became iconic throughout the 1960s–1980s for its extreme nutrient enrichment and associated macroalgal bloom issues (McComb et al., 1981). Thick blankets of green algae, dominated by Willeella brachyclados (previously Cladophora montagneana) and Chaetomorpha linum, covered Peel Inlet and some parts of Harvey Estuary, leading to massive accumulations of rotting weed. Seagrass also retracted due to algal smothering (Bradby, 1997; Hodgkin et al., 1980). The Dawesville Channel (‘Cut’) built in 1994 to help mitigate these algal blooms through increased tidal flushing certainly led to major shifts in the hydrology and nutrient levels of the estuary. Hydrodynamic modelling undertaken in other parts of the Linkage Project has shown, for example, that the Cut reduced water retention time in autumn from ~100 to 50 days in Peel Inlet and from ~150–200 to 50–80 days in Harvey Estuary (Huang et al., 2019a). There have also been other, more incremental shifts in estuarine condition since the Cut opened 25 years ago, mainly through ongoing catchment development and climate change (F. Valesini et al., 2019). Under our increasingly drier climate, for example, water retention times have now increased back towards pre-Cut levels in some parts of the estuary (Huang et al., 2019a). This study has collated existing long-term monitoring data of macrophyte biomass across the estuary basins, and undertaken new surveys of the macrophyte community, to produce a data set spanning four decades from 1978 to 2018. While there are several gaps in the monitoring record, this data provides a rare opportunity to explore how the seagrass and macroalgal communities of the Peel-Harvey have changed over the last 40 years, covering periods in the height of the macroalgal bloom issues, those just before and after the Cut, then more recent ones. Although some previous studies have examined changes in these plant communities in select years, e.g. before (1985–1991) and after (1994–1999) the Cut (Wilson et al., 1999), and in 2009 (Pedretti et al., 2011), this is the first to examine changes over the full sampling record, as well as statistically explore their environmental drivers. We also develop a simple index of macrophyte condition (‘health’), and propose a monitoring plan for the future. The specific objectives are as follows. 7.3 Objectives Characterise the long-term (1978–2018) shifts in the macrophyte community in the Peel-Harvey Estuary, and determine any key water quality drivers. Characterise, in finer detail, the current (2017–18) macrophyte community throughout the Peel-Harvey Estuary. Calculate a simple macrophyte condition index and explore its trends throughout the estuary over the last 40 years. Propose an ongoing monitoring regime for tracking macrophyte health throughout the Peel-Harvey Estuary. 7.4 Approach 7.4.1 Long-term (1978–2018) trends in macrophyte communities and their drivers 7.4.1.1 Collating the long-term data sets Macrophyte biomass has been sampled in various years from 1978 to 2018 throughout the basins of the Peel-Harvey Estuary. To help with exploring long-term trends in the macrophyte community, sampling years were grouped into interannual ‘periods’, which typically contained four-six years, except in the more recent times when they contained one or two years. A summary of this long-term sampling regime is provided in Table 1 and a map of the sites that were sampled regularly is in shown in Fig. 1. This map also shows the estuarine regions (southern and northern Harvey Estuary; western and eastern Peel Inlet) and water depth category (shallow &lt;1.5 m; deep &gt;1.5 m) to which sites were assigned. Aside from 2017–2018, when sampling was undertaken as part of the current ARC Linkage Project (see section 4.2), all surveys were carried out by the Marine and Freshwater Research Laboratory (MAFRL) at Murdoch University (Pedretti et al., 2011; e.g. Wilson et al., 1999). Macrophyte surveys over the last 40 years have varied in the (i) frequency and timing during any one year (one–four times per year), (ii) number of sites sampled (30 to 51 sites) and (iii) resolution to which macrophyte taxa were identified, i.e. fine (species or genus ) vs broad (phylum or division; Table 1). To maximise data consistency between years, as well as the number of years that could be included for analysis, the data were harmonised in the following ways. As autumn and spring were the most frequently sampled seasons across years, only data collected at these times of year were used. Long-term trends were examined separately for each of these seasons because of differences in their sampling regimes (Table 1), and because macrophyte growth often changes seasonally in response to environmental changes. Only data collected from regularly sampled sites (i.e. visited in at least five of the sampling years) were included in the data set, i.e. those shown in Fig. 1. Only broad groups of macrophyte taxa (i.e. seagrass; green macroalgae; brown macroalgae; red macroalgae; charophytes) were examined across all sampling years, since this was the extent to which taxonomic classifications were consistently recorded from 1978–2000. In addition to the long-term macrophyte dataset, complementary data on various water quality parameters known to influence macrophyte growth (see below) were also collated from the weekly to monthly measurements made at six routine water monitoring sites throughout the estuary since 1977 by the Department of Water and Environmental Regulation (DWER) and other agencies such as MAFRL (see Fig. 1). Measurements recorded at the water surface and bottom for the following parameters were collated for each of the years and seasons (autumn and spring) in which macrophytes were sampled. Surface measurements were matched with nearby shallow macrophyte sites, and bottom measurements were matched with nearby deeper sites. Salinity Water temperature (°C) Turbidity, and particularly the extent to which light penetrates to the estuary bottom (reflected by Secchi depth scaled to a proportion of total water depth, i.e. 0, clear waters; 1, completely turbid) Total phosphorus concentration (µg L−1)     Total nitrogen concentration (µg L−1) Additionally, to help with detecting any ‘growth response’ by the macrophytes to preceding water quality conditions, water measurements recorded over the two months prior to each macrophyte sampling event were also collated, and used to create a ‘time lag’ data set. Note that, due to some inconsistencies in the water quality monitoring record when not all of the above parameters were measured when macrophytes were sampled, some years had to be excluded from both data sets, i.e. 1978 in autumn and 1981 in spring (Table 1). Figure 7.2: Oliver Krumholz, coring for macrophytes (Photo, S. Cronin-O’Reilly). Figure 7.3: Map of the sites at which macrophytes were regularly sampled in the Peel-Harvey Estuary from 1978–2018, and the stations at which water quality was monitored by the Department of Water and Environmental Regulation. Additional macrophyte sites sampled only in 2017–18 are highlighted, and the estuarine regions and water depths to which each site was assigned are also shown. 7.4.1.2 Field and laboratory methods At each field site on each sampling occasion, five replicate samples of the macrophyte community were taken by pushing a 9 cm diameter Perspex® core at least 10–15 cm deep into the sediment, then sealing it with rubber bungs to capture above and below-ground macrophyte biomass (Fig. 2). Figure 7.4: Example of a sediment core used to sample macrophyte biomass across the estuary (Photo, O. Krumholz). In the laboratory, all macrophytes in each replicate core were sorted into individual taxa, oven dried at 70°C, then the dry weights (g) of each taxon recorded. The resulting data from the five replicate cores were used to calculate the mean biomass of each taxa (weight per unit area; g m−2) at each site on each sampling occasion. Further details on field and lab methods can be found in Wilson et al. (1999), Pedretti et al. (2011) and Krumholz (2019). 7.4.1.3 Data analyses 7.4.1.3.1 Long-term macrophyte trends and links with water quality: Analysis of the 1978–2018 biomass data in each season focused on determining any changes in the macrophyte community between interannual periods, and the water quality drivers that were best correlated with any macrophyte shifts (both before and after a two-month time lag was applied to the water quality data; see section 4.1.1). Necessarily, these analyses also included other key elements of the sampling design, namely the estuarine region and water depth (shallow, deep) from which samples were collected, to account for any confounding effects. However, only those significant findings involving period differences were explored further. Most data analyses were undertaken in the Primer v7 multivariate statistics software (Clarke and Gorley, 2015) with the PERMANOVA+ add-on module (Gorley and Clarke, 2008, +). Spatial interpolations of macrophyte biomass data throughout the estuary were undertaken in ESRI ArcMap v10. Details of all data pretreatments, statistical routines employed, test designs and routine settings are given in Krumholz (2019). Guides for interpreting the main outcomes of these analyses are provided in the ‘Main Findings’ section. 7.4.1.3.2 Macrophyte condition index: A simple index of the condition or ‘health’ of the macrophyte community, and thus the estuary, was calculated from the autumn data for all periods from 1978–2018. The premise of the index was that communities dominated by seagrass rather than green macroalgae reflect more desirable or ‘healthier’ estuarine conditions, with both the ratio and total biomass accounted for the assessment of macrophyte health. Broadly, the index was calculated by (i) determining the proportion of seagrass to green algal biomass in each field sample; (ii) weighting that proportion by the total biomass of seagrass and green algae (after it was standardised by the maximum value in the sampling record) and; (iii) placing all values on a common 0–1 scale then assigning them to five condition categories (1, ‘excellent’ to 0, ‘very poor’). Index categories were spatially interpolated throughout the estuary for each period using ESRI ArcMap v10. A full account of the methods for calculating and displaying the index are given in Krumholz (2019). It is important to note that the 0–1 index scale, and hence the condition categories, are relative to macrophyte trends observed only in the Peel-Harvey from 1978–2018. 7.4.2 Current trends in macroalgae and seagrass biomass (2017–18) The current macrophyte community was sampled in both spring 2017 and autumn 2018 at all 51 sites shown in Fig. 1. Several new sites were added to this sampling regime to improve coverage in certain sections of the estuary (see sites marked on Fig. 1). The field and lab methods were the same as those described in section 4.1.2, except that each macrophyte taxa was identified to species rather than broad phyla or division level as in previous surveys (Table 1). In contrast to the long-term macrophyte data set, the data analysis approach for the current data set focused equally on exploring the nature and extent of any differences in species biomass composition among estuarine regions, water depths and seasons. The same software as described in section 4.1.3 were used for these analyses. Full details of these analyses are given in Krumholz (2019). 7.5 Main Findings 7.5.1 Long-term (1978–2018) trends in macrophyte communities and their drivers Green macroalgae has decreased and seagrass has increased from 1978–2018, except in the southern Harvey Estuary where green macroalgae has increased Significant changes have occurred in the macrophyte community over the last 40 years (Fig. 3; Appendix 1). The extent of these interannual period changes has been substantial, especially in autumn when they were more influential than any macrophyte changes due to differences in estuary regions or water depth (Appendix 1). In general, there has been a clear decline in green macroalgal biomass over time, especially after the Dawesville Cut. Whereas green algae represented ~84% of the overall biomass in the late 1970s to mid-1980s (period 1), it was &lt;20% in the most recent period in autumn (period 5, 2018) and 43% in spring (period 4, 2009 and 2017). However, seagrass has increased dramatically post-Cut and more so in recent years, dominating overall biomass in autumn (~70% in period 5) and representing about half the biomass in spring (46% in period 4; Fig. 3). Inter-period shifts in the macrophyte community are shown in more detail for each region of the estuary in the ‘shadeplots’ in Fig. 4 (simply the darker the shading, the greater the biomass). Green algal and seagrass biomass are also interpolated across the whole estuary (based on site measurements) in Figs 5 and 6. In general, these plots show that reductions in green macroalgae over time have been most marked in Peel Inlet (in both the western and eastern sides in autumn and the western side in spring), while seagrass has increased most obviously in the northern Harvey, followed by Peel Inlet (Figs 4–6). Figure 7.5: Average contribution of each broad macrophyte group to the overall biomass in each period from 1978–2018 in autumn (top) and spring (bottom). The large shift in the macrophyte community following the Cut, especially in the northern Harvey and western Peel regions located closest to this channel, are also reflected in Fig. 7. Simply, years lying close together on these plots have more similar communities while those further apart have greater differences, and it was clear that there was a notable jump between pre- and post-Cut periods. While there was also a shift in the eastern Peel Inlet over time (mainly in autumn), it was a more gradual progression (Fig. 7). The macrophytes of the southern Harvey Estuary, however, have shown different long-term responses to other regions of the estuary. Although green algal biomass decreased from the late 1970s to just prior to the Cut in the early 1990s, it has again increased substantially in recent years (Figs 4–6). This was particularly so in spring, where green macroalgal biomass in period 4 (2009, 2017) was higher than that for any macrophyte group across the whole estuary in the full 40 year sampling timeframe. Additionally, seagrass in the southern Harvey virtually disappeared after the mid-1980s (period 1), which may in part reflect further smothering by the extreme blue-green algae blooms in the Harvey Estuary from the late 1970s–1980s McComb and Humphries (1992), combined with the particularly long water residence times in that poorly flushed part of the estuary (pre-Cut: ~150–200 days in autumn and ~50–75 days in spring, compared to ~100 and ~50 days, respectively, in Peel Inlet, Huang et al., 2019a), which leads to other negative effects such as greater nutrient retention. While there has been a small (autumn) to moderate (spring) recovery of seagrass in the most recent period, it has not increased to the same extent as in other regions (Figs 4–6). It is noteworthy that, while water retention in the southern Harvey fell just after the Cut (~75 days in autumn and 25 days in spring), it is now returning back towards pre-Cut levels (Huang et al., 2019a). The lack of clear directional changes in the macrophyte community of the southern Harvey from 1978–2018 is also reflected by the lack of separation of different periods on the plots in Fig. 7. Figure 7.6: Shadeplots of average biomass of each macrophyte group in each period (from 1978–2018) and estuarine region in autumn (top) and spring (bottom). Biomass is shown on a grey scale from highest biomass (black) to absent (white). *Average biomass values, which have been derived from the data recorded at each site, are presented on a pretreated (square-root transformed, dry weight g m-2) not raw scale. Figure 7.7: Average autumn biomass of green macroalgae (top) and seagrass (bottom) interpolated throughout the Peel-Harvey Estuary in each period from 1978–2018. Interpolated values were derived from the average biomass at each site in each period. Figure 7.8: Average spring biomass of green macroalgae (top) and seagrass (bottom) interpolated throughout the Peel-Harvey Estuary in each period from 1978–2018. Interpolated values were derived from the average biomass at each site in each period. Figure 7.9: Plots showing the relative similarity of macrophyte communities in each year (black labels) from 1978–2018 (years closer together have more similar macrophyte compositions) and each region during autumn (top) and spring (bottom). Consecutive years in each period are joined by colour-coded lines. Plots have been constructed using MDS ordination. Another (but lesser) exception to the general long-term trends across most of the estuary was the eastern Peel Inlet, especially in spring, where green algal biomass is still comparatively high (Figs 4, 6). Growths are particularly abundant in the shallow south-eastern corner, which has long been a ‘problem area’ for nuisance macroalgae, and appear to have increased from post-Cut periods to the most recent period in both seasons (Figs 5, 6). Given this area is very shallow and close to the mouth of the Murray River, the recurrence of high green algal biomass is not surprising following seasonal increases in temperature (and shallow waters that are quick to warm) and, especially in spring, a new flush of nutrients from preceding winter river flows. Across the broader eastern Peel region, there has been a slight decline in spring algal biomass since the mid-1980s (Fig. 4), which could reflect both markedly lower river flows (~50% drop in flow from the Murray sub-catchment since the 1970s, F. Valesini et al., 2019) and greater tidal flushing. Longer-term shifts in the macrophyte community show strong links with reductions in total nitrogen concentrations The distinct changes in the autumn macrophyte communities of the northern Harvey Estuary and western Peel Inlet from 1978–2018, especially after the Cut, were strongly linked with reductions in total nitrogen concentrations (TN) in the water column. For each of these regions located closest to the Cut, this was the case both when TN recorded close to the time of macrophyte sampling was correlated with the macrophyte data (BEST, P = 0.01, Spearman rank correlation [ρ] = 0.697 for Harvey north and 0.52 for western Peel), and after a two-month lag was applied to the water quality data to allow for a macrophyte growth response (BEST, P = 0.01, ρ = 0.668 for Harvey north and 0.44 for western Peel). This clear relationship can be seen in Fig. 8, which shows annual trends in the macrophyte community (black year labels) with the corresponding TN concentrations overlaid as circles of proportionate sizes. Note that, since trends in the ‘non-lag’ and ‘lag’ TN data were similar, only the former are shown. In both regions, the large macrophyte shifts in the post-Cut periods (4–5), which were due to declines in green algae and increases in seagrass (Fig. 4), were clearly linked with a large drop in TN from pre-Cut periods. Correlations between longer-term trends in the spring macrophyte communities and corresponding water quality parameters were also significant, but not as strong. In both the western and eastern Peel Inlet, moderate correlations were found when a combination of lag salinity, temperature and, for the western Peel, also total phosphorus concentration, was used (BEST, P = 0.001, ρ = 0.439–0.489). In general, the longer term changes in the macrophyte community (as shown in Fig. 7), were linked with increasing salinities and temperatures and decreasing total phosphorus (TP) concentrations (overlaid plot not shown). Average salinity across the Peel Inlet and Harvey Estuary has increased from ~26 in the pre-Cut periods, to ~32 from 1994-mid-2000s, and again slightly over the last decade (~33), reflecting additional influences of climate change such as reduced river flow (see earlier) and rising sea level (2.6 mm yr−1 from 1970). TP concentrations, like TN, fell rapidly following the Cut (annual TP averages of ~150 µg L−1 pre-Cut and ~50 µg L−1 post-Cut) and have continued to fall over recent decades (F. Valesini et al., 2019). Figure 7.10: Plots showing the relative similarity of macrophyte communities in each year from 1978–2018 (black labels; years closer together have more similar communities), with TN concentration overlaid as circles of proportionate sizes. Separate plots are shown for the northern Harvey and western Peel regions. Plots constructed using MDS ordination of macrophyte biomass composition data. The ‘health’ of the macrophyte community has improved in most regions of the estuary, but remains poor in the southern Harvey Estuary The current condition of the macrophyte community, as reflected by the scaled contributions of seagrass as opposed to green macroalgae, is the best that has been observed over the last 40 years in most areas of Peel Inlet and the northern Harvey Estuary, rating good to excellent (A–B) on the relative ‘health’ index scale. However, the communities in the southern Harvey remain in fair to poor condition (C–D; Fig. 9). Trends in the condition index from 1978–2018 show that, in general, the macrophyte community was at its least healthy in the mid to late 1980s, when it was fair to very poor across most of the estuary (Fig. 9). This mainly reflected a pronounced loss of seagrass across the system compared to 1978–1984, combined with green macroalgal biomass remaining relatively high (Fig. 5). Whereas the condition of the Peel Inlet macrophytes then gradually improved from 1990 to 2018, the condition of the Harvey Estuary (especially the southern region) continued to fall, reaching very poor status in 1995–2000, i.e. virtually no seagrass, but moderate levels of green macroalgae which had increased from just before the Cut (1990–1994; Figs 5 and 9). While green macroalgal biomass has continued to increase in the southern Harvey in recent years (2018; Figs 5 and 9), there has also been a small recovery of seagrass, leading to an improvement in the overall health score for this part of the estuary. The northern Harvey Estuary on the other hand has shown a striking improvement in macrophyte condition post-Cut, reaching ‘excellent’ status in 2018 and reflecting strong seagrass colonisation and a concurrent reduction in green algae (Figs 5 and 9). Figure 7.11: Macrophyte condition index categories interpolated throughout the Peel-Harvey Estuary in each period from 1978–2018. Index values have been calculated from data recorded in autumn in each sampling year. * It is important to note that the 0–1 index scale, and hence the condition categories, are relative to macrophyte trends observed only in the Peel-Harvey from 1978–2018. 7.5.2 Current trends in macroalgae and seagrass species composition (2017–18) The macrophyte community is dominated by seagrass, except in the southern Harvey Estuary Twenty three macrophyte species were found across the Peel-Harvey in the most recent sampling during spring 2017 and autumn 2018 (Appendix 2; Fig 10). Most of these species were red macroalgae (nine species), followed by green and brown algal species (six and four species, respectively), while three seagrass species and only one charophyte species were recorded (Appendix 2; Fig 10). The species richness of the macrophyte community has increased when compared to the only other previous study in the estuary in which all taxa were identified to species (i.e. Pedretti et al., 2011). Whereas 14 macrophyte species were found in spring 2009 (Pedretti et al., 2011), 18 were recorded in spring 2017 (Appendix 2). Based on total biomass at all sampling sites in both seasons, however, the current macrophyte community is clearly dominated by seagrass (56%), most of which is Ruppia sp. (44%) with smaller contributions by Halophila sp. and Zostera sp. (~11%; Appendix 2; Fig 10). Green macroalgae represent just over a third of the current biomass, with Willeella sp. (19%) and Chaetomorpha sp. (13%) being the most abundant in this macrophyte group. Despite being the most speciose group, red macroalgae made up only 5.5% of the overall biomass, and was represented mainly by Chondria sp. and Spyridia sp. Brown macroalgae and Charophytes contributed only a small proportion to the overall biomass, with the former comprised mainly of Hormophysa sp. and the latter entirely of Lamprothamnium sp. (Appendix 2; Fig 10). The dominance of seagrass in the current macrophyte community has developed only in the last decade. The survey by Pedretti et al. (2011) in spring 2009 showed that only 38% of the overall biomass was seagrass (as opposed to 60% in spring 2017 at the same sites), while 50% was green macroalgae (27% in spring 2017). Additionally, the dominant type of seagrass has changed. While Zostera sp. made up nearly half of the seagrass biomass in 2009 (and was found mainly in the northern Harvey and western Peel near the Cut, Pedretti et al., 2011), Ruppia sp. is now clearly not only the dominant seagrass, but also the most dominant taxa in the whole macrophyte community. Zostera sp. represented only 8% of seagrass in spring 2017, with its total biomass value being about a third of that found in 2009. When trends in the macrophyte community composition were tested statistically, significant differences were found between regions of the estuary and water depth, but not between seasons (Appendix 3). The seagrass Ruppia sp. was the dominant species in the shallows of all regions except the southern Harvey, where it was matched in terms of biomass by the nuisance green macroalgae species Willeella sp. and Chaetomorpha sp. (Figs 11–12 and photos opposite). The latter green algal species was also common in the shallows of eastern Peel Inlet. In the deeper waters, however, each of these three species were either absent or less prevalent. The seagrass Halophila sp. was instead relatively abundant in all regions except the southern Harvey, and Zostera sp. was also abundant in the western Peel. The red algae Chondria sp. made a moderate contribution to the macrophyte biomass in the deeper parts of Peel Inlet, while Chaetomorpha sp. dominated the deeper southern Harvey. Figure 7.12: Nuisance green macroalgae in the southern Harvey; Willeella sp. overlying black anoxic sediment (left) and Chaetomorpha sp. (right; Photos, S. Cronin-O-Reilly). Figure 7.13: Percentage contributions of each broad macrophyte group to the total macrophyte biomass (across all sampling sites in spring 2017 and autumn 2018) and the contribution of each species comprising each group. Figure 7.14: Shadeplots of average biomass of each macrophyte taxa in each region and water depth in 2017–2018. Biomass is shown on a grey scale from highest biomass (black) to absent (white). Average biomass values, which have been derived from the data recorded at each site, are presented on a pretreated (square-root transformed, dry weight g m-2) not raw scale. Figure 7.15: Average biomass of abundant macrophytes recorded in spring 2017 and autumn 2018 (seagrasses Halophila sp. and Ruppia sp. and green macroalgae Chaetomorpha sp.), interpolated throughout the Peel-Harvey Estuary. Interpolated values were derived from the average biomass at each site in each season. Spatial trends in the current macrophyte community are best correlated with total nitrogen and total phosphorus concentrations The current macrophyte community shows a gradual progression in composition from the more marine-dominated northern Harvey Estuary and western Peel regions, where seagrasses Ruppia sp. and Halophila sp. dominate the shallows and deeper waters respectively (Fig. 11), to the eastern Peel Inlet and then southern Harvey Estuary, where green macroalgal species Willeella sp. and/or Chaetomorpha sp. are most abundant. Figure 13a summarises these trends, capturing the above compositional shifts (from left to right) in macrophyte samples averaged for each region and water depth. The distinction between the shallow and deeper macrophyte communities can also be seen (top vs bottom of the plot, respectively). These spatial changes in the macrophyte community were moderately well correlated with total nitrogen concentration (TN) in the water column (after a two-month lag was applied to the water quality data; BEST, P = 0.04, Spearman rank correlation = 0.351). This is also shown in Fig. 13, with the TN values overlaid on the macrophyte samples. Clearly, the progression from a seagrass to algal dominated community was linked with increases in total nitrogen. The higher nitrogen values in the surface than deeper waters, especially in both Peel regions in spring 2017, most likely reflect nutrient flushes into the estuary from the preceding winter river flow. Similar relationships were found between the macrophytes and total phosphorus (TP) concentration when the data sets were correlated at a finer spatial (site × depth) resolution (Fig. 13). Although the correlation was quite weak (BEST, P = 0.05, Spearman rank correlation = 0.19), it was clear that the green-algal dominated macrophyte samples from the southern Harvey were linked with notably higher TP concentrations (Fig. 13).

The values of (a) total nitrogen concentration (with a two-month time lag) and (b) total phosphorus concentration, have been overlaid as circles of proportionate sizes. Plots constructed using MDS ordination of macrophyte biomass composition data. 7.6 Conclusions The macrophyte community has changed over time, and mostly for the better The macrophyte community of the Peel-Harvey Estuary has changed significantly from 1978–2018 from one dominated by green macroalgae (late 1970s to at least the early 2000s) to one dominated by seagrass (possibly in the last decade, but more likely only in the last five years). Based on the index of macrophyte condition (and by extension, estuarine ecosystem health), the above changes correspond with a change from fair–very poor (index grade C–E) throughout much of the estuary in 1985–1989, to fair to excellent (index grade C–A) in 2018. The macrophyte community in the southern Harvey, however, continues to be dominated by green algae (‘poor’ condition in 2018) and is showing worrying trends. While some seagrass is now growing in this region after its complete loss from the mid-1980s to early 2000s, green algae still dominates and has increased in biomass since the last (2009) survey. This is particularly true of the nuisance species Willeella brachyclados, which is only abundant in this region. High green macroalgal biomass also still persists in the shallow south-eastern corner of Peel Inlet. Nutrient concentrations are the main drivers of observed long-term and current changes in the macrophyte community The main environmental drivers of both the long-term (1978–2018) and current (2017–2018) trends in the macrophyte community are either total nitrogen or total phosphorus concentration in the water column. Broadly, shifts from green macroalgal to seagrass-dominated communities were linked with clear reductions in nutrient availability. Despite the marked changes in various other examined water quality variables following the Cut, as well as further incremental shifts with climate change (i.e. increasing salinities, temperatures and water clarity, Huang et al., 2019a, 2019b; F. Valesini et al., 2019), the strongest and most convincing correlations were still found with changes in the above nutrient concentrations. Continuing and standardising the macrophyte monitoring regime is fundamental for assessing ongoing macrophyte health and better understanding key drivers The 1978–2018 macrophyte biomass record for the Peel-Harvey Estuary is a rare biotic data set that has enabled exploration of long-term changes in the macrophyte community. Yet, it has several limitations that preclude a more thorough understanding of macrophyte trends, including inconsistencies in the level of taxonomic identification (and hence only broad groups for most of the data) and the number of sampling sites and seasons. There are also large gaps between some consecutive surveys, including between the current 2017–2018 survey and the previous one in 2009. Additionally, biomass only captures one perspective of the plant community, whereas others such as spatial cover are also important. To better assess the ongoing health and environmental drivers of this macrophyte community, and determine if its recent move towards seagrass domination reflects a stable shift, it is imperative that a consistent and regular macrophyte monitoring program is continued into the future. A broad program for future monitoring of the Peel-Harvey seagrass and macroalgal communities is proposed in Table 2. This program is purposely broad, outlining the main macrophyte components to be monitored and suggested methods. Finer details for implementing this program will need to be determined, following clarity in level of interest in uptake and resourcing. 7.7 Acknowledgements We are particularly grateful to the Marine and Freshwater Laboratories at Murdoch University for generously sharing the historical macrophyte data they had collected across the Peel-Harvey Estuary from 1978–2009.

Living on or just below the sediment, they play vital ecosystem roles such as decomposing organic matter, recycling nutrients and providing a major food source for fish and birds. They can also provide key ‘signals’ about the condition of the benthic environment, and have been used worldwide to develop biotic indices for measuring and tracking estuarine health. However, many of these indices have been developed for northern hemisphere systems, and applying them to south-western Australian estuaries has proved difficult and/or ineffective for various reasons. This report was aimed firstly at characterising the current benthic macroinvertebrate community throughout the Peel-Harvey Estuary, and secondly at building a robust biotic index of benthic ecological health (the Estuarine Benthic Community Index – EBCI) and exploring its patterns across the estuary. We also explored which aspects of the benthic environment were best linked to changes in the invertebrate community and health grades (‘A’, excellent, to ‘E’, very poor) of the EBCI. Our findings show that while the current invertebrate community is species rich (72 species), it is dominated by a small number of environmentally-tolerant taxa, including various worm species (e.g. Capitella sp., Heteromastus filiformis and Prionospio cirrifera) and bivalve species (e.g. Arthritica semen and the invasive Asian date mussel Arcuatula senhousia). The community is generally representative of one in early stages of development (or ‘early succession’), which are typically found in environments that experience chronic stress. The invertebrate community showed substantially greater differences between regions of the estuary (e.g. basin vs riverine areas) than between seasons (winter vs summer) or different water depths (shallow, &lt; 1 m vs deep, &gt; 1m). These regional differences were strongly linked with those in bottom-water salinity, depth of oxygen penetration into the sediment, sediment odour and sedimentary microalgae (which provides food for many invertebrate taxa). To build the EBCI, a diverse suite of 16 attributes (‘metrics’) calculated from the invertebrate community were first tested for their responsiveness to an independent gradient of benthic environmental condition across the Peel-Harvey Estuary. Three metrics (species richness, diversity and dominance) showed the clearest responses, and were then used to construct an index that incorporated metric reference conditions (or benchmarks of ‘best’ metric scores) that were tailored for each broad region and season. The EBCI showed that benthic ecological health is generally better in winter (mainly good to fair, or grades B–C) than summer (mainly fair to poor, or grades C–D). These trends most likely reflected the effects of winter river flows flushing sedimentary organic matter out of the estuary, and helping oxygenate the bottom waters and sediment. This is well supported by the clear relationships that were found between increasing EBCI grade and decreasing trends in sedimentary organic matter and mud content and increasing oxygen penetration and odour score. From a spatial perspective, benthic ecological health was often poorest (poor to very poor, or grades D–E) in the deeper waters of the upper Murray River, the deeper sections of the basins (especially in summer) and in the shallow south-eastern area of Peel Inlet (including in the deeper navigational channels near the entrance of the Murray River). In some cases, the sediment was completely lacking in invertebrate fauna. These areas coincide with some of the most highly enriched (nutrients and organic matter) and muddy sediments and, in the case of the south-eastern Peel, areas of high macroalgal growth. These findings have significant implications for the ongoing benthic health of the estuary, given the forecast trends of less freshwater flushing of the estuary under a drying climate, and the proposed expansion of marina developments and boating channels within the Peel-Harvey Estuary. Finally, we have proposed a benthic invertebrate monitoring plan to enable the ecological health of the Peel-Harvey to be reliably tracked into the future, and provide further decision support for management intervention. Figure 8.1: Bait worm Marphysa sanguinea, showing gill structures (Photo, S. Cronin-O’Reilly). 8.2 Background Benthic macroinvertebrates are bottom-dwelling invertebrates, &gt; 500 µm in size, that live on the sediment surface or just below it in structures such as burrows or self-made tubes (Snelgrove, 1998). These faunal communities consist mainly of polychaetes (worms), molluscs (e.g. bivalves) and crustaceans (e.g. shrimps and crabs; Figure 8.2). They are a fundamental component of the healthy functioning of estuarine ecosystems, performing vital roles such as decomposing the vast organic matter that accumulates in these environments, recycling nutrients and providing rich food sources for many fish and bird species. They are also excellent indicators of the ecological health status of estuaries and other waterways, which is reflected by well-established changes in the species composition of the invertebrate communities. For example, degraded estuaries often have faunas with low numbers of species that are dominated by polychaetes, which are often more tolerant of environmental stress than the more sensitive molluscs and especially crustaceans (Tweedley et al., 2012; e.g. Warwick and Clarke, 1993; M. D. Wildsmith et al., 2009). Benthic macroinvertebrates are bottom-dwelling invertebrates, &gt; 500 µm in size, that live on the sediment surface or just below it in structures such as burrows or self-made tubes (Snelgrove, 1998). These faunal communities consist mainly of polychaetes (worms), molluscs (e.g. bivalves) and crustaceans (e.g. shrimps and crabs; Figure 8.2). They are a fundamental component of the healthy functioning of estuarine ecosystems, performing vital roles such as decomposing the vast organic matter that accumulates in these environments, recycling nutrients and providing rich food sources for many fish and bird species. They are also excellent indicators of the ecological health status of estuaries and other waterways, which is reflected by well-established changes in the species composition of the invertebrate communities. For example, degraded estuaries often have faunas with low numbers of species that are dominated by polychaetes, which are often more tolerant of environmental stress than the more sensitive molluscs and especially crustaceans (e.g. Warwick and Clarke (1993); M. D. Wildsmith et al. (2009); Tweedley et al. (2012)). Figure 8.2: Examples of benthic invertebrates collected from the Peel-Harvey. (Photos; 1a &amp; c, S. Cronin-O-Reilly; 1b, M. Wildsmith). For the above reasons, many environmental management agencies worldwide have developed biotic indices based on key attributes of these invertebrate communities to measure and track the ecological health of estuaries and other aquatic environments. They provide key ‘signals’ about ecosystem functioning that cannot be captured by simply measuring the environment alone. Some of the most well-known and widely adopted indices include the Azti Marine Biotic Index (Borja et al., 2000), the Benthic Opportunistic Polychaete and Amphipod ratio (Dauvin and Ruellet, 2007) and the Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity (Weisberg et al., 1996). Many of these existing indices focus on the tolerance of different invertebrate species to environmental stress (e.g. organic matter enrichment) and have largely been developed for estuaries in the northern hemisphere, for which extensive knowledge exists on species sensitivity. However, applying these indices to estuaries in south-western Australia (and others in the southern hemisphere) has proved difficult or ineffective because (i) our small, shallow and increasingly poorly-flushed estuaries function differently from the often larger and well-flushed systems of the northern hemisphere, and (ii) our invertebrate faunas are very dissimilar, and their sensitivity is largely unknown (Tweedley et al., 2014). To date, studies of the benthic macroinvertebrate communities in the Peel-Harvey Estuary have concentrated on restricted parts of the estuary basins, times of year and/or subsets of the faunal community, with their main focus on exploring inter-decadal changes between pre-Dawesville Cut (1970s or 1980s) and post-Cut periods (early to mid-2000s: Whisson et al., 2004; M. D. Wildsmith et al., 2009). Both of these studies have generally shown the loss of more environmentally-sensitive crustacean and molluscan taxa and increases in more tolerant annelid taxa over time. Given it has been 15 years since the benthic invertebrate faunas have been assessed across the Peel-Harvey, and no previous studies have included the faunas in the tidal rivers, the first part of our study was aimed at characterising the current benthic macroinvertebrate community throughout the full extent of the estuary. Secondly, as a comprehensive index of benthic ecological health is still lacking for this system (and most others across south-western Australia), we then focused on building a suitable and robust index from the benthic macroinvertebrate community (the Estuarine Benthic Community Index – EBCI) and exploring its patterns across the estuary. The specific study objectives are outlined below. 8.3 Objectives Characterise the current benthic macroinvertebrate community throughout the full extent of the Peel-Harvey Estuary during both wet and dry seasons. Explore which environmental drivers are best linked to any spatial or seasonal changes in the invertebrate community. Build an index of benthic ecological health (the EBCI) using key attributes (‘metrics’) of the invertebrate community, and develop a benthic health ‘report card’ (grades A–E) for the estuary. Explore trends in the EBCI among estuary regions and seasons in 2017–18, and which sediment condition variables are best linked to those trends. Propose an ongoing monitoring regime for tracking benthic ecological health throughout the Peel-Harvey Estuary. 8.4 Approach 8.4.1 Characterizing the benthic invertebrate community and the benthic environment 8.4.1.1 Field and laboratory methods Benthic macroinvertebrates were collected at 60 sites throughout the Peel-Harvey Estuary during both late winter 2017 (high rainfall period – ‘wet’ season) and late summer 2018 (low rainfall period – ‘dry’ season; Fig. 8.3). The location of the sampling sites was governed by the following three factors to account for both anthropogenic and natural environmental influences on the condition of the benthic environment and their accompanying invertebrate communities. Sites were positioned to provide the best possible spread across these factors (with the first being of primary interest), while also keeping the time requirements for both field sampling and laboratory processing within an achievable window. The condition of the sediment (i.e. Good, Fair or Poor), as determined by the Rapid Assessment Protocol (RAP) for characterizing sediment condition, based on scores for sediment colour, odour and texture developed by Hallett et al. (2019a) and presented in the complementary ARC Linkage report Hallett et al. (2019b). The guide for how the sediment at each site was scored and assigned to a RAP class is given in Table 1, with some examples shown in Fig. 8.4. Regional differences in water movement (e.g. tidal and river flushing) and water quality (e.g. salinity, dissolved oxygen, temperature), as guided by the coupled catchment-estuary model developed within the broader ARC Linkage Project (Huang et al., 2019; Hipsey et al., 2019). The main regions were the Southern Harvey Estuary; Northern Harvey Estuary/Western Peel Inlet; Eastern Peel Inlet; Serpentine River; Lower Murray River; Upper Murray River (Fig. 8.3). Water depth, accounting for both shallow (&lt; 1 m deep) and deeper (≥ 1 m deep) waters. It is recognized that the effects of human-derived stressors (e.g. the downstream impacts of high catchment nutrient loads, organic matter loads from livestock effluent etc.) and natural environmental influences act synergistically to influence benthic environmental condition in estuaries. However, sediment condition was considered to mainly reflect the culmination of anthropogenic influences in the catchment and estuary, while regional and depth differences were considered to represent natural environmental drivers. Figure 8.3: Map of the sites at which benthic macroinvertebrates were sampled across the Peel-Harvey Estuary in winter 2017 and summer 2018. Sites have been colour-coded by their RAP sediment condition class in summer 2018 (green, Good; yellow, Fair; red, Poor; see Table 1 and Fig. 3). Note that these condition classes differed for some sites in winter 2017, as shown in Figs 11 and 12. Figure 8.4: Cores of sediments classified as (a) Good, (b) Fair and (c) Poor condition based on their RAP scores for sediment colour, texture and odour (from Hallett et al., 2019b). The RAP sediment condition classification of 97 sites across the estuary by Hallett et al. (2019b) in late 2016 was used as an initial guide for selecting a representative subset of invertebrate sampling sites. At each selected site (and in each season), two replicate sediment cores were collected using a corer with a telescopic pole and a detachable, transparent PVC tube (60 cm long and 6 cm in diameter; Fig. 8.5). One of the replicate cores was used to measure various characteristics of the sediment, as outlined in Table 2. The remaining replicate sediment core was wet-sieved through a 500 µm mesh, and all invertebrates retained were preserved in a 4% formalin solution buffered in estuary water. In the laboratory, all invertebrate samples were stored in a 70% ethanol solution, then the numbers of individuals belonging to each species (or lowest possible taxon) counted in each sample. Various water quality characteristics, including salinity, temperature (°C) and dissolved oxygen (mg L−1), were also recorded at the bottom of the water column at each site on each sampling occasion using a multiparameter water quality probe (YSI 556). Figure 8.5: (a) Collecting sediment cores using a telescopic corer with a detachable PVC coring tube; (b) Sieving sediment samples to collect benthic invertebrates (Photos, S. Cronin-O’Reilly). 8.4.1.2 Data analyses Analysis of the 2017–18 invertebrate species abundance data focused on determining the nature, extent and environmental drivers of any significant shifts in community composition between estuarine regions, seasons, water depths and sediment condition. Note that, while every effort was made to find sites representing each sediment condition class (i.e. Good, Fair, Poor) in each region, season and depth, they were not present in all combinations of those latter three factors. Consequently, analyses of invertebrate community differences among condition classes were undertaken separately from the combined analyses for region x season x depth, though were guided by the outcomes of the latter test (i.e. condition x region x depth tests were undertaken separately for each season, and only those significant terms involving condition were further interpreted). The footnote on p11 provides further technical explanation on the practicalities and drawbacks of this testing approach, and the subsequent choices for other condition-based analyses in section 4.2. The environmental variables that were correlated with the invertebrate data included all of the sediment variables outlined in Table 2, as well as the water quality variables measured at the time of faunal sampling (see section 4.1.1). All data analyses were undertaken in the Primer v7 multivariate statistics software (Clarke and Gorley, 2015) with the PERMANOVA+ add-on module (Gorley and Clarke, 2008). 8.5 Building an index of benthic ecological health An index of benthic ecological health (the EBCI), reflected as a ‘report card’ grading system from A (excellent health) to E (very poor health), was built from key attributes (‘metrics’) derived from the invertebrate species abundance data outlined in section 4.1.2. The list of candidate metrics that were trialed, and the ones that were selected to comprise the index, are shown in Table 3. The method used to construct this index is summarised in Fig. 8.6, which outlines from left to right (i) the main steps in building the index; (ii) further detail underpinning each main step; (iii) the main statistical methods used (all of which were undertaken in the Primer v7 multivariate statistics software (Clarke and Gorley, 2015) with the PERMANOVA+ add-on module (Gorley and Clarke, 2008)); (iv) key data inputs into the statistical methods; and (iv) main outputs of the statistical methods. The overarching approach was similar to that for the Fish Community Index, broadly outlined in Hallett et al. (2019b) and described in detail in Chris S. Hallett et al. (2019c). The main difference between these approaches was that whereas a large historical and current data set was available to build a time-based gradient for selecting the most informative fish metrics (numerous interannual periods between 1978–2018), this was not the case for the invertebrate data [with historical data existing only for the late 1970s, 1986/7, 2000 and 2003/4, and sometimes for only restricted parts of the basin, times of year and/or subsets of the invertebrate community; Whisson et al. (2004); M. D. Wildsmith et al. (2009)]. Instead, a continuous spatial ‘benthic condition gradient’, built from key sediment variables shown to best reflect differences in sediment condition scores throughout the estuary, was used as the premise for selecting the most informative (i.e. responsive) invertebrate metrics. To display EBCI trends throughout the estuary in both the wet and dry seasons, EBCI scores calculated at each sampling site were spatially interpolated across the full extent of the system using QGIS 2.18. Figure 8.6: Summary of the approach used to build the Benthic Community Index, outlining, from left to right, (i) the main steps in constructing the index; (ii) more detail underpinning each main step; (iii) main statistical methods used; (iv) key data inputs into the statistical methods (PCA, Principal Components Analysis; BEST, Biota and Environment Matching routine; DISTLM, Distance Based Linear Models) and (iv) main statistical outputs. 8.6 Main Findings The benthic invertebrate community is species rich, but dominated by a small number of taxa that are highly tolerant to environmental stress and represent only the early stages of community development More than 70 benthic invertebrate species were found across the estuary in 2017–18 (Appendix 1). They represented nine broader phyla, but more than 75% of species belonged to just two phyla, namely Annelida (worms; 30 species) and Arthropoda (crustaceans such as shrimps and crabs; 23 species). Thirteen species of Mollusca (shelled organisms) were found, but the remaining six phyla were each represented by only one taxon (Appendix 1). We found a greater overall number of species than M. D. Wildsmith et al. (2009) in 2003–04 (63), most likely because this previous study was restricted to northern Harvey Estuary/western Peel Inlet whereas the current study covered the full breadth of the estuary and the tidal rivers. Species such as the worms Desdemona ornata and Pseudopolydora kempi and the bivalves Mysella spp. and Arcuatula senhousia, were abundant in this study, but were either not recorded or found in low numbers by M. D. Wildsmith et al. (2009). The largely marine and well-flushed northern Harvey/western Peel region had by far the most species (55), while the upper Murray River had the least (18). This decline in species richness along a marine to riverine gradient is common in south-western Australian estuaries, not only for benthic invertebrates (e.g. Wildsmith et al., 2017), but also for other fauna such as fish (e.g. Valesini et al., 2017). However, 60% of the species found in the northern Harvey/western Peel each made very small contributions (≤0.5%) to the total number of invertebrates recorded in that region, with many being ‘marine stragglers’ that occur infrequently in the marine reaches of estuaries, e.g. the worms Heteromastus filiformis, Malacoceros sp. and Mediomastus sp. In contrast, only 28% of the species in the upper Murray made similarly small contributions to the fauna in that region, reflecting a more restricted community that is well adapted to deal with environmental stress. Further evidence of this is the far lower total abundance of invertebrates found in the upper Murray, i.e. about one third to one fifth of that in other regions (Appendix 1). Figure 8.7: Examples of common invertebrates (a) Corophium minor, (b) Arthritica semen, (c) Arcuatula senhousia (Photos; S. Cronin-O-Reilly). The amphipod Corophium minor (Fig. 8.7), a small crustacean that is endemic to south-western Australia, was the most abundant species across all basin regions. The polychaete worms H. filiformis and Prionospio cirrifera, which live on the sediment surface and feed on accumulated organic matter, were highly abundant in the western Peel/northern Harvey and/or eastern Peel Inlet, and especially in the deeper waters where these organic deposits are often greatest. The small bivalve Mysella spp. was also abundant across Peel Inlet and the northern Harvey, where it mainly inhabited sandier substrates. Tanaid crustaceans, which were highly abundant only in the southern Harvey Estuary, live in self-made tubes in the sediment and feed mainly on detritus and algae (Rumbold et al., 2015). Their abundance in this region is possibly symptomatic of the long-term and increasing macroalgal growths that are present there (Valesini et al., 2019). Regions of the estuary that directly receive freshwater input (i.e. the Serpentine and Murray rivers and, to a lesser extent, the southern Harvey Estuary), all had high numbers of the small bivalve A. semen (Fig. 8.7) and the worm Simplisetia spp. These species are both adapted to live in brackish reaches of estuaries (Hirst, 2004; Semeniuk and Wurm, 2000). Large aggregations of A. semen, and to a lesser extent the worms D. ornata and Capitella sp., were mainly responsible for the high total number of invertebrates recorded in the Serpentine River (Appendix 1). In the freshest parts of the estuary (i.e. the upper then lower Murray River), further species such as the invasive Asian date mussel A. senhousia (Fig. 8.7), the amphipods Paracorophium excavatum and Grandidierella spp., and the worms P. kempi and Boccardiella limnicola, were also relatively abundant. Many of the above-mentioned dominant species in the Peel-Harvey Estuary are recognised globally as highly tolerant and opportunistic, e.g. the worms Capitella sp., H. filiformis, P. cirrifera, P. kempi and the Asian date mussel A. senhousia (Tweedley et al., 2015). Such taxa represent the first stages of invertebrate community development following an environmental disturbance, as they are small, short-lived and can reproduce quickly, allowing them to readily colonise uninhabited areas (Pearson and Rosenberg, 1978). This so-called pattern of ‘early succession’ has also been found in other coastal waterways experiencing chronic environmental stress, both through natural processes [e.g. highly variable salinity; Ritter et al. (2005)] and human-driven processes (e.g. organic and nutrient enrichment of sediments; Tagliapietra et al. (2012); Fig. 8.8]. Additionally, unlike many large suspension/filter feeding invertebrate species that typify healthy estuaries in the northern hemisphere, many of the common species in the Peel-Harvey and nearby Swan-Canning Estuary lack a pelagic (floating or swimming) larval stage in their development (Rose et al., 2019). Instead, species such as A. semen brood their young in their shell cavity (Wells and Threlfall, 1982) and Capitella sp. broods in self-made tubes (Rose et al., 2019). This may be an adaptive strategy to safeguard their early life stages from stressful conditions, but also restricts species dispersal and the rate of community succession, keeping it in an early stage of development. Figure 8.8: Benthic invertebrate community development along a gradient of increasing environmental stress. Diverse faunas are gradually replaced by a small number of dominant species (often highly tolerant worms and select bivalves). Regional differences in salinity and sediment oxygen, odour and microalgae exert the greatest influence on the invertebrate community Regional differences in the benthic invertebrate community throughout the estuary were generally about twice as strong as differences among seasons (winter vs summer), water depth (shallow vs deep) or sediment condition class (Good, Fair, Poor). The community still differed significantly among each of the latter factors, but the magnitude of change was usually far smaller (Appendix 2). Regional shifts in the fauna were strongly correlated with combinations of salinity, depth of the sediment oxic layer, sediment odour and the quantity of microalgae living near the sediment surface (BEST, P = 0.01–0.02, Spearman rank correlation = 0.78–0.87). The regional patterns in the species composition of the invertebrate fauna are illustrated on the plots in Figs 8.9 and 8.10. They have been displayed for each season (Fig. 8.9) and water depth (Fig. 8.10) to accommodate significant ‘interaction effects’ with those other sampling factors (i.e. contrasting regional trends across different seasons and depths; Appendix 2a). Based on the simple premise that points lying close together on these plots have similar faunas while those further apart have greater differences, it is clear that there was a distinct shift in the invertebrate communities between the estuary basins (western Peel/northern Harvey, eastern Peel and south Harvey regions, all lying to the left on plots) and the tidal Murray River (lower and particularly the upper regions, lying to the right), while those in the Serpentine River bridged this spectrum. The key invertebrate species that mainly drove these regional shifts in the community are summarised in the ‘shadeplots’ in Figs. 8.9 and 8.10 (simply the darker the shading, the more abundant the species). The basin regions were characterised by a wider spectrum of species, including many with affinities for the marine conditions and/or abundant seagrass and macroalgae present in that part of the estuary. These included various amphipods (e.g. C. minor, Eusiridae spp. and Grandidierella spp.), bivalves (Spisula trigonella and Mysella spp.) and tolerant worms (H. filiformis and P. cirrifera). The Serpentine River was distinctive for its particularly high numbers of the worms D. ornata (though only in the wet season), Capitella sp. and Simplisetia spp., as well as the tolerant bivalve A. semen (especially in the dry season and in the shallows). The key species in the Murray River, however, differed from those in the Serpentine. In the lower Murray, the crustaceans Grandidierella spp. and P. excavatum and the worms Scoloplos normalis and P. kempi dominated, but largely in the dry season and in shallows. In the wet season and/or deeper waters, the invertebrate fauna was relatively depauperate and comprised mainly tolerant or opportunistic species, e.g. midge larvae (Chironomidae spp.) and worms such as oligochaetes and Capitella sp. Faunas in the upper Murray were also restricted, and were largely represented by highly tolerant worms (B. limnicola, S. normalis), the invasive Asian date mussel (A. senhousia) and other taxa with affinities for fresher waters (e.g. Chironomidae spp. and Coleoptera spp.). The regional shifts in the invertebrate community from basin to riverine areas were shown to be best linked with (i) decreasing salinities from marine to essentially freshwater conditions; (ii) less oxygen permeating the sediment; (iii) increasingly malodorous sediment; and (iv) increases in sediment microalgae (Fig. 8.11). With respect to salinity, regional differences were far greater in winter when they ranged from an average of ~31 in the western Peel/northern Harvey (close to sea water) to ~2 in the upper Murray (fresh water; 8.11). Marine waters (~35) permeated most regions in summer, except for the upper Murray which remained brackish (~15). In contrast, the shallowing of the sediment oxic layer between the basin and riverine regions was more apparent in summer (Fig. 8.11).

Abundance is shown on a grey scale from most abundant (black) to absent (white), and has been plotted from pretreated not raw data. These trends match the long water residence times in the estuary during low river flows (Huang et al., 2019), which in turn leads to deoxygenation of the bottom waters and the sediment. Interestingly, low sediment oxygen persisted year-round in the Serpentine River (~0.7–1.5 cm of oxic sediment; 8.11), and was also prevalent in some basin regions (southern Harvey and eastern Peel) in one or more seasons. The most malodourous sediments (reflecting the production of hydrogen sulphide or ‘rotten-egg gas’ under anoxic conditions) matched several of the trends in sediment oxygen, being worst in the deeper waters of the upper Murray, Serpentine River and the shallows of the eastern Peel (Fig. 8.11). ‘Signals’ of these environmental conditions were evident in the invertebrate fauna. For example, the worm Capitella sp., which was far more abundant in the Serpentine than any other region and dominated in both seasons and water depths, is well able to persist in low oxygen conditions (Diaz et al., 1995). Other closely related species are also highly tolerant of hydrogen sulphide (Gamenick et al., 1996). The most obvious regional shifts in the amount of sediment microalgae, which provides a food source for deposit-feeding invertebrates, were the far lower quantities in the most marine and highly flushed region (western Peel/northern Harvey) compared to the upper Murray (Fig. 8.11). These trends almost certainly reflect the far lower sediment nutrient concentrations in the western Peel/northern Harvey than any other part of the estuary, and particularly the upper Murray, most of which is highly enriched (Hallett et al., 2019b). The higher microalgal concentrations in the shallows than deeper waters of most regions (Fig. 8.11) very likely reflects the greater light availability in those environments to support benthic algal growth. A separate set of tests to explore sediment condition impacts on the invertebrate community in each season showed that they were relatively strong in winter, when their influence was not too far behind that of regional differences and far stronger than depth differences (Appendix 2b). Faunas in the poor sediment class were the most distinct, and were generally characterised by less species than their ‘fair-good’ counterparts, as well as lower abundances of species that were present. Additionally, species such as the worms Australonereis ehlersi (which builds U-shaped burrows in sandy sediments and has strong jaws for eating other invertebrates; Beesley et al., 2000) and D. ornata [a predominantly deposit-feeding fan worm that is relatively sensitive to environmental stress; Borja et al. (2000); Rossi (2002)] showed clear preferences for good sediments and were mostly absent from poor sediments. The fauna also differed significantly among condition classes in summer, with poor vs good sediments being most distinct, but these differences were comparatively weak (Appendix 2c). It should be noted, however, that since not all condition classes were well represented in each region, season and depth combination3, these findings may underrepresent the true influence of sediment condition on the invertebrate fauna. Further exploration of how particular attributes (‘metrics’) of the invertebrate community relate to the full spectrum of sediment condition is presented below in the findings for the EBCI. Figure 8.11: Plots showing the relative similarity of invertebrate communities in each region (colour-coded; see Fig. 8 for full names) and season (a; W, Wet; D, Dry) or depth (b–d; S, Shallow; D, Deep). Invertebrate sample points (those closer together have more similar communities) have been overlaid with key sediment condition variables (represented by circles of proportionate sizes) known to best ‘explain’ the observed patterns in the fauna. Plots have been constructed using MDS ordination. The benthic ecological health of the estuary was mainly good to fair in the wet season, but fair to poor in the dry season The EBCI, interpolated across the whole estuary from the index scores calculated for each site in each season, showed that overall benthic health was better in the wet than dry season (Figs 11 and 12). In the wet season, large sections of the basins (excepting the south-eastern Peel Inlet) were classified as having a good (B grade) to far (C grade) health status, with some sites near the Dawesville Channel and in the shallows of the northern Harvey in excellent health (A grade; Fig. 11). Most of the Serpentine River was also in fair to good benthic health, while this was only true for intermittent sections of the Murray River and mainly in its shallow lower reaches. In the dry season, however, most of the basins were in fair (C grade) to poor (D grade) benthic health (excepting again some healthy sites near the Cut and in the shallows), with some sites near navigation channels in the eastern Peel Inlet (Yunderup canals) in very poor condition (E grade; Fig. 12). Most of the upper Murray was also in poor to very poor condition (D/E grade), though the lower Murray and Serpentine typically had a fair to good health status (C/B grade), with a few sites even being in excellent health (A grade). The poorer health grades in the dry season, which were especially evident in the deeper waters, mainly reflected conspicuous decreases in species richness and diversity (Fig. 13). This was particularly evident in the upper Murray River, with several samples containing no invertebrates at all (Fig. 13d). In the shallows, health declines between the wet and dry season were most obvious in the eastern Peel Inlet, and were driven mainly by a drop in species diversity (Fig. 13a, c). The generally healthier benthic condition in the wet season is most likely related to the freshwater flushing of the system at that time of year, helping to remove sedimentary organic matter and increase oxygenation of the bottom waters and sediment. This is well supported by the clear relationships that were detected between increasing health grades of the benthic invertebrate community, and decreasing trends in sedimentary organic matter and mud content and increasing oxygen penetration and odour score (Fig. 14). Although there was general agreement between the benthic health grades (A–E) and the RAP sediment condition grades (Good, Fair, Poor), which can be seen by comparing the BCI scores (interpolated ‘background’ colours) with the RAP grades (colour-coded sites) in Figs 11 and 12, there were a few exceptions. For example, several sites in the Murray River in the wet season had a low BCI grade (D–E) but a Good RAP grade. This may reflect the influence of higher freshwater flows improving sediment condition (e.g. by flushing out organic matter and mud), but also dislodging invertebrate fauna.

Figure 8.15: Averages of each sediment condition variable (aRPD [oxic sediment depth], odour, organic content, left y-axis; mud content, right y-axis) in each Benthic Community Index grade (A, excellent to E, very poor). Benthic ecological health is generally poorest in the deeper waters of the upper Murray River, deeper waters of the basins and in the south-eastern Peel Inlet Poor to very poor EBCI grades were most commonly recorded in the deeper waters of the upper Murray River, the deeper sections of the basins (especially in the dry season) and in the shallow south-eastern area of Peel Inlet (including the deeper navigational channels near the entrance of the Murray River; Figs 11, 12). The deeper parts of the upper Murray were characterised by faunas with a low species richness and diversity in winter, and were highly depauperate in summer when they either contained just one species or were totally lacking invertebrate fauna (Fig. 13b, d). The deeper waters of all basin regions, and especially the southern Harvey Estuary, had among the lowest species richness and/or diversity in summer, as did the shallows of the eastern Peel in both seasons (Fig. 13). The above areas typically corresponded with either fair to poor RAP sediment condition in the current study (Figs 11 and 12), and the most highly enriched (including both nutrient and organic matter content) and muddier sediments found by Hallett et al. (2019b) in the companion study on sediment health. These poorer quality sediments, and subsequently less healthy benthic invertebrate faunas, typically intersect with poorly flushed, depositional environments. The shallow south-eastern Peel Inlet also has a high biomass of green macroalgae, which has largely persisted throughout the 40-year macrophyte monitoring record in the Peel-Harvey Estuary and even increased in recent years (Valesini et al., 2019). Large accumulations of macroalgae can also contribute to sediment deoxygenation and enrichment, with the sediment acting as a source of nutrients to fuel further macrophyte growth (Lavery and McComb, 1991). These findings have significant implications for the ongoing benthic ecological health of the estuary, given the forecast trends of less freshwater flushing under a drying climate, and the proposed expansion of marina developments and boating channels within the Peel-Harvey Estuary. 8.7 Conclusions The benthic invertebrate community generally reflects a stressed benthic environment Although a large number of benthic invertebrate species was recorded throughout the estuary in 2017–18, the community was mainly dominated by a small number of environmentally-tolerant taxa. These species are reflective of a community in its early stages of development, or one that is typically found following an environmental disturbance, i.e. recolonisers that are small, short-lived and reproduce rapidly. The main environmental drivers of changes in the species composition of the invertebrate community included some that are natural (salinity and the amount of sedimentary microalgae) and others that are often linked to human-derived stressors (the depth of oxygen penetration into the sediment and strong sediment odours). Benthic ecological health is in a poor to very poor state in poorly-flushed, depositional areas of the estuary The EBCI developed in this study detected poor to very poor benthic ecological health (grades D–E) in many depositional areas of the estuary, such as the deeper waters of the upper Murray River, deeper sections of the basins, and the south-eastern Peel Inlet (including both the shallows and deeper navigational channels near the entrance of the Murray River). This was particularly the case in summer, when there is virtually no river flushing and water residence times are high. These poor ecological health grades were clearly linked to increasing sediment organic matter and mud content and little to no oxygen penetrating the sediment. Given the projections for an increasingly drier climate, and proposed expansions of marina developments and boating channels within the Peel-Harvey Estuary, it is anticipated that these benthic ecological health trends will become more persistent and expansive. This could have a host of flow-on effects for the ecological function, resilience and biodiversity of the estuary, through channels such as its ability to recycle nutrients and organic matter, and provide nutritious food for higher fauna such as fish and birds. Establishing a regular benthic invertebrate monitoring regime is fundamental to assessing and tracking measures to improve ongoing benthic ecological health The 2017–18 invertebrate species abundance data has enabled a comprehensive understanding of the current invertebrate community in the Peel-Harvey Estuary, and provides a greater spatial spread of information on this fauna than has ever been collected across the system. It has also enabled calculation of the EBCI. However, given that the EBCI is based on data collected over just one year, the metric reference conditions on which the grading system is based are limited. To strengthen understanding of the ‘best’ metric values (and open the possibility of including further metrics in the index that begin to show strong responses to sediment condition), it is recommended that at least a further four consecutive years of invertebrate data are collected (see Table 4) to help bolster the robustness of the EBCI. Following on from the above, it is imperative that a consistent and regular invertebrate monitoring program is continued to better assess the ongoing health and environmental drivers of this key ecosystem component into the future. A broad program for the future monitoring of the benthic health of the Peel-Harvey via the EBCI (and accompanying RAP) is proposed in Table 4 and Fig. 15. Finer details for implementing this program will need to be determined, following clarity in level of interest in uptake and resourcing.

Their component species typically occupy habitats from the top to bottom of the water column, feed across most levels of estuarine food webs, and encompass varied behavioral traits and estuarine use patterns. Taking a community-wide view can thus reveal many clues about the cumulative and complex impacts of the estuarine environment on higher ecological health. As a result, biotic indices that integrate key traits of fish communities, scored against established ‘benchmark’ or reference conditions, have been used to measure, monitor and report the ecological health of estuaries worldwide.  This study focused on applying a Fish Community Index (FCI) to the Peel-Harvey Estuary to measure and track its ecological health over a 40-year period from 1978 to 2018. It also aimed to link patterns in the FCI to key environmental drivers to support forecasting of ecological health under different environmental scenarios. The FCI, which was developed specifically for south-western Australian estuaries, synthesises complex information from different structural and functional measures (metrics) of the fish community into simple ‘report card’ grades (A, very good, to E, very poor). The long historical fish community data set that exists for the Peel-Harvey was supplemented by two further years of fish sampling in the current study (2016-2018), which covered a greater spatial range in both the shallow (&lt;1.5 m deep) and deeper waters (&gt;1.5 m deep) than had ever been sampled previously. While this 40 year data set provides a rare basis for setting metric benchmark conditions (especially in the shallow basins where most historical data was collected), inconsistencies in sampling methods over time, gaps in the data record, and a relative lack of data in the deeper waters and rivers, has hampered some interpretations of longer-term health. Moving forward, we have proposed a consistent fish monitoring regime for the Peel-Harvey to enable its ecological health to be reliably tracked with the FCI into the future.  Based on the available evidence, our findings show that there has been a slight improvement in the health of the shallow river environments from 1978-2018, from poor (grade D) to fair (grade C), while the shallow basin waters have remained in fair health. The condition of the deeper waters, however, and especially in the basins, has declined from a good health status (grade B) to a fair/poor status (grade C/D). The improvements in the shallow rivers mainly reflect an increased dominance of small hardyhead species that are specialist feeders and can spawn in the estuary, rather than the opportunistic or detritus-feeding species that previously dominated these areas. The more obvious decline in the deeper basins, however, reflected a clear shift in the fish fauna from one that was relatively species-rich, abundant and contained more benthic-associated and/or estuarine individuals (all of which positively influence the FCI, e.g. Estuary cobbler, Mulloway, Yellow-finned whiting and Western striped grunter), to one that is more depauperate (with no fish being caught on several sampling occasions), sporadic and dominated by marine species (traits which negatively influence the FCI, e,g. Tailor, Southern eagle rays, Herring and Weeping toadfish). The opening of the Dawesville Cut in the mid-1990s, combined with a drying climate, has clearly led to a ‘marinisation’ of the fish fauna. However, the above declines in ecological health may also reflect (i) declines in the health of the benthic invertebrate fauna upon which many of these species feed, (ii) decreases in green macroalgal growths (especially in Peel Inlet) which can provide abundant fish food and shelter, (iii) increased water clarity and thus net avoidance and/or (iv) fishing pressure impacts on targeted species. More detailed analysis of the current (2016–2018) FCI trends showed that, overall, the estuary is in fair to poor health (grades C–D). At a finer regional and seasonal resolution, trends in the shallow nearshore waters were often inconsistent, possibly reflecting that large areas of the basins are extremely shallow and prone to rapid environmental changes, and are dominated by small, highly-schooling species which can lead to variable catches. One worrying trend that was consistent in the shallows, however, was the often poor to very poor health (grade D–E) in the Mandurah Entrance Channel. This reflected a far lower number of species since the 1970s/80s, as well as clear drops in abundance of various specialist feeding, estuarine-spawning and/or bottom-dwelling species (e.g. Long-finned goby, Bridled goby and Small-toothed flounder), and increases in the relative proportions of opportunistic species such as Weeping toadfish. Trends in the deeper waters were generally more discernible, and indicated that (i) the health of the basins is generally better than in the rivers (and especially in the Murray River); (ii) the more tidally-flushed basin regions (northern Harvey Estuary, western Peel Inlet and, to a lesser extent, eastern Peel Inlet) are often in better health (good to fair, grades B–C) than the poorly flushed southern Harvey (fair to poor, grades C–D), and (iii) the upper Murray River appears to be in chronically poor ecological condition (grade D), characterised in most seasons by only two or three species which are either detritivores or opportunistic omnivores (Sea mullet, Perth Herring or Black Bream). The population status of the latter species, which is prized by recreational fishers, is also vulnerable due to poor recruitment of juveniles and low abundances of adults above minimum legal length at capture. These trends most likely reflect the susceptibility of the upper Murray to salinity stratification of the water column, high organic matter loading, and the persistent low dissolved oxygen levels that develop as a result. Finally, when FCI scores were statistically correlated with a suite of environmental variables, bottom water age, dissolved oxygen content and salinity were shown to have the greatest influence on ecological condition. In the deeper waters of the rivers, the best ecological condition occurred when dissolved oxygen content was highest and when the bottom water age was between 50 and 100 days. Poor FCI scores in this region occurred shortly after flooding (very low water age) and when bottom water became stagnant (water age &gt;100 days). In the shallow waters of the rivers increasing salinity had a weak positive effect on FCI scores, while in the shallow waters of the basins, hypoxia area (% of region with dissolved oxygen content &lt; 2 mg/L) had a weak negative influence. These quantitative responses of the FCI to specific environmental variables provides a basis for predicting the future ecological condition of the system under various environmental scenarios.  9.2 Introduction Healthy, diverse and productive estuarine fish communities require good water quality, the availability of appropriate habitats and good connectivity between estuarine, marine and freshwater environments. Human activities can degrade estuaries and disrupt these requirements, resulting in the loss of particular species or groups (‘guilds’) of fish. Environmentally-sensitive fish species, including those that cannot tolerate widely ranging salinities or low levels of oxygen, or those with specialized feeding strategies or habitats, are typically lost first as estuary health declines (Fig. 9.1). Conversely, species that are highly tolerant and/or are more generalist in their requirements, can often dominate communities when the environmental niches previously occupied by less robust species become available. The structure of fish communities can therefore provide important signals about the ecological health of an estuary and the ways in which it is impacted by human activities, climate change and other pressures. Even though fish communities occupy higher ecological levels than other biotic indicators such as plankton or benthic invertebrates, they are known to be excellent indicators of estuarine condition (or ‘health’) since their component species vary widely in their (i) feeding levels (e.g. from primary to secondary consumers), (ii) habitat types (e.g. fresh to hypersaline waters, bottom-dwelling to open water, bare to vegetated substrates), (iii) the ways in which they use estuaries (e.g. nurseries to permanent residence) and (iv) life spans (e.g. one year to decades). Consequently, their ability to capture ‘signals’ from acute to chronic environmental changes, is vast (Perez-Dominguez et al., 2012; Richardson et al., 2011; e.g. Whitfield and Elliott, 2002). Figure 9.1: Conceptual diagram of predicted responses of the estuarine fish community to poor and good ecological condition (‘health’). Images courtesy of the Integration and Application Network, University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science (ian.umces.edu/symbols/). Reproduced from Hallett et al. (2019a). Biotic indicators based on fish communities are now used to measure and monitor the ecological health of estuaries worldwide (Martinho et al., 2015; Perez-Dominguez et al., 2012), although Australia has been slower to adopt this approach (Hallett et al., 2016). However, one fish-based indicator that has been developed specifically for south-western Australian estuaries is the Fish Community Index (FCI, Hallett and Valesini, 2012). The FCI integrates data on various characteristics (‘metrics’) of the fish community to generate ecological condition scores (0–100), which are then assigned to corresponding ‘report card’ grades (A, very good – E, very poor) that are easily understood by the wider community The FCI was originally developed for the Swan-Canning Estuary, where it has been used by the Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions for annual monitoring and reporting of estuary health since 2012. It has also been adopted in the Walpole-Nornalup Estuary by the Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development (Fisheries) since 2017 (Chris S. Hallett et al., 2019a; Yeoh et al., 2019).  In this study, we aimed to adapt and apply the FCI to the Peel-Harvey Estuary to quantify patterns in its ecological health over the past four decades. We also sought to relate observed FCI scores to estuarine environmental conditions [as derived from the estuary response model developed in Chapters 3 and 4 to determine which elements were the key drivers of ecological health.  It should be noted that while the fish communities of the Peel-Harvey Estuary have been studied periodically since the late 1970s, these surveys have typically differed in their sampling methods. Not only have different net types been used over time, but the fish communities in the tidal rivers and deeper waters of the estuary have been poorly studied. This study therefore involved an extensive fish sampling campaign to expand the collective fish data set for this system, and develop a fuller understanding of ecological health responses to environmental stressors. This campaign has also provided a good framework for designing a robust fish monitoring regime to allow the FCI to be tracked into the future. 9.3 Objectives The specific objectives of this research study were to: Customize the Fish Community Index (FCI) to the Peel-Harvey Estuary, and calculate an ecological health ‘report card’ (grades A–E) for all historical (1979–2014) and contemporary (2016–2018) fish community samples collected throughout the system. Examine broad trends in estuarine ecological health over the last four decades (1979–2018) and finer-scale trends among estuary regions and seasons in 2016–2018. Compare observed FCI health scores to model-derived environmental data to identify the key environmental stressors of estuarine ecological health. Propose an ongoing fish monitoring regime for tracking the ecological health of the Peel-Harvey Estuary into the future. 9.4 Approach 9.4.1 Applying the FCI to the Peel-Harvey Estuary 9.4.1.1 Collection and collation of data All available fish community data for the Peel-Harvey Estuary were collated, comprising fish species abundances collected throughout the shallows and deeper waters of the basins and tidal rivers. These included historical data sets, collected by various Murdoch University researchers in select periods from 1979 to 2014, and those collected in the current study (2016–2018; Fig. 9.2). Full details of the historical and current fish sampling regimes can be found in the published accounts of those studies (see Table 9.1).  Figure 9.2: Map of the sites at which fish communities were sampled in the Peel-Harvey Estuary from 1979–2018. In the current study, fish were sampled throughout the estuary in eight consecutive seasons from autumn 2016 to summer 2018, typically in the middle month of each season. In the nearshore shallow waters (&lt;1.5 m deep), fish were collected using a 21.5 m long seine net during the day, while in the deeper waters (typically &gt;1.5 m deep), they were collected using multi-mesh gill nets at night. The dimensions and mesh sizes of these nets (see Christopher S. Hallett et al., 2012 for details) were consistent with those used in several of the historical studies. All fish were immediately either identified to species or placed in an ice slurry and taken to the laboratory for subsequent identification. The total number of individuals belonging to each species in each sample was recorded.  For historical samples collected using different seine net types to that used in the current study, all data were standardised (using a generalised linear modelling method as detailed in Hallett and Hall, 2012)to minimize the effects of varying net lengths and mesh sizes, and converted to number of fish 100 m−2. For samples collected with gill nets, all data were converted to equivalent catch rates (fish hr−1). Note that whilst these standardizations minimized (as far as possible) the effects of different sampling gear on fish abundances, some biases may remain (Hallett and Hall, 2012). Table 9.1: Summary of the historical (1979–2014) and contemporary (2016–2018) fish species abundance data sets collected across the Peel-Harvey Estuary in (a) shallow waters and (b) deeper waters.

Hallett et al., 2019a). The metrics which comprise the FCI, and which are known to provide a robust basis for quantifying estuarine ecological health in south-western Australia (e.g. Hallett et al., 2016), are listed in Table 9.2. Figure 9.3 summarizes the process for calculating the FCI, which has been described extensively elsewhere (Hallett, 2014; Christopher S. Hallett et al., 2012). The following subsections briefly outline this process, emphasizing the modifications used to customize the FCI for the Peel-Harvey Estuary. Firstly, all fish species in the collated and standardised data sets (section 9.4.1.1) were assigned to functional groups (‘guilds’) that reflected their habitat, feeding mode and use of the estuary (see Supplementary Material S9.1). Values for each fish metric (Table 9.2) were then calculated for every fish sample collected in the shallow and deeper waters between 1979 and 2018.  Table 9.2: Metrics comprising the Fish Community Index (FCI) for shallow and deeper waters of the Peel-Harvey Estuary. Predicted metric responses to ecological degradation are shown in parentheses; positive metrics (+) increase with increasing degradation, whilst negative (−) metrics decrease as the ecosystem becomes more degraded.

Values for each metric in each fish sample were then converted to scaled (0–10) scores, based on their deviation away from established benchmark values (‘reference conditions’). Note that these reference conditions were defined for each estuary region and season to account for natural spatial and seasonal variations in metric values (Chris S. Hallett et al., 2012). To derive the reference conditions, the best value recorded for each metric across all fish samples collected between 1979 and 2017 (hereafter referred to as the ‘training data set’), were used. Note that the data from the second year of contemporary sampling (2017–2018) was retained as a ‘validation data set’ for independent testing of the relationships between FCI condition grades and modelled environmental outputs (see section 9.4.2).  Scaled metric scores were then combined to produce an index score (0–100) for each sample. Each index score was then compared to threshold values (Table 9.3), derived statistically from the distributions of all index scores in the training data sets (after Hallett, 2014). This enabled the corresponding ecological health grade (A, very good, to E, very poor) to be determined for each sample. Intermediate grades (e.g. B/C, good-fair, or C/B, fair-good) were awarded if the sample index score was within one point of a grade threshold. Table 9.3: Fish Community Index (FCI) score thresholds defining each of the five ecological health grades (A–E) for both shallow and deeper waters of the Peel-Harvey Estuary. Condition grade Shallow water FCI scores Deeper water FCI scores A (excellent) &gt;77.67 &gt;71.00 B (good) 66.33–77.67 54.00–71.00 C (fair) 58.59–66.33 41.00–54.00 D (poor) 46.50–58.59 10.40–41.00 E (very poor) less than 46.50 less than 10.40 9.4.1.3 Exploring trends in the FCI To explore broad, long-term trends in the ecological health of the estuary, the mean FCI scores in the shallow and deeper waters were plotted in each fish sampling year from 1979 to 2018, both for the estuary as a whole and for the basin and river regions separately. To understand the fish species which were mainly responsible for driving observed trends in the FCI, complementary plots of species abundances across the whole community were constructed, as were plots of the mean number of species. These data analyses were undertaken in the Primer v7 multivariate statistics software (Clarke and Gorley, 2015) with the PERMANOVA+ add-on module (Gorley and Clarke, 2008). To explore the current (2016–2018) ecological condition of the estuary in more detail, a series of maps were constructed showing the mean FCI in each region and season in the shallow and deeper waters. Note that this period included a large and unseasonal rainfall event in February 2017, which brought large amounts of organic matter and sediment into the estuary, followed by a sustained period of low to no dissolved oxygen in autumn 2017 that particularly impacted the upper Murray River region. 9.4.2 Relating estuary condition to modelled environmental changes We aimed to identify the key environmental drivers of estuarine ecological health (as assessed by the FCI) and, in particular, the environmental stressor thresholds that best ‘explain’ each of the ecological health classes (i.e. A, excellent, to E, very poor). Generalised additive models (GAMs) were used to relate observed FCI scores from 1978–2017 to a range of environmental stressor metrics derived from the coupled estuary response model developed in other parts of the research project (see Chapters 3 &amp; 4). These metrics included various water quality parameters (e.g. temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen concentration) as well as measures of the frequency, severity, extent and/or persistence of stressors such as hypoxia, harmful algal blooms and ammonium concentrations. A detailed list of these stressors, which were calculated at both the site and estuary region scales, is given in Supplementary Materials S11.2. The GAMs analyses were conducted separately for the shallow and deep waters of the basins and the rivers. In each case, a suite of models was tested using many combinations of environmental metrics to determine the ‘best-fit’ model, or that which best ‘explained’ observed trends in the FCI scores.  The above best-fit models were then used to predict FCI scores and condition grades based on known or modelled environmental data, allowing the ecological condition of the estuary to be estimated under any future environmental scenario. The reliability of these GAM predictions was tested by (i) predicting FCI scores for all sampling occasions in a validation data set (i.e. the FCI data recorded in autumn 2017–summer 2018), based on the modelled environmental stressor data, and (ii) comparing the predicted FCI grades with those calculated directly from the corresponding fish species abundance data. 9.5 Results &amp; Findings 9.5.1 Broad long-term (1979-2018) trends in estuary condition The ecological health of the shallows has improved from poor to fair in the rivers, but has remained fair in the basins over the last 40 years Plots of the mean FCI in each sampling season and year from 1979–2018 showed that, on average, the ecological condition of the shallow nearshore waters has improved slightly over time in the rivers (from poor, grade D, to fair, grade C), but has remained fair in the basins (Fig. 9.4a). As a result, the health of the shallows across the whole estuary has also apparently improved (Fig. 9.4b).  Examination of the shallow water fish communities in both the basins and rivers shows that there has been a notable shift in the dominant species over time, and especially between the 1970s-1980s and later periods (see the shadeplots in Supplementary Materials S9.3 and S9.4; simply, the darker the shading, the more abundant the fish species). Whereas several species with freshwater affinities were abundant in the earliest period (e.g. River garfish Hyporhamphus regularis in both the rivers and basins, and Perth herring Nematalosa vlaminghi and Southwestern goby Afurcagobius suppositus in the rivers), they were either not recorded or were caught far less consistently in later periods. Instead, a relatively restricted suite of species, several of which have marine affinities or can withstand very high and variable salinities, have dominated the fauna from the mid-1990s onwards. In the rivers, these included the Elongate hardyhead Atherinosoma elongata, Wallace’s hardyhead Leptatherina wallacei, Weeping toadfish Torquigener pleurogramma and, in some seasons, Sandy sprat Hyperlophus vittatus (Supplementary Materials S9.4), while in the basins they included Weeping toadfish, Long-finned goby Favonigobius lateralis, Silverfish Leptatherina presbyteroides andElongate hardyhead. This ‘marinisation’ of the fish fauna, which was also reported by Potter et al. (2016), almost certainly reflects the increased tidal flushing brought about by the Dawesville Cut, combined with a drying climate. These factors have interacted to produce more stable, saline conditions that have pushed further upstream into the estuary over time (Chapter 3). A similar marinisation trend has also occurred in the shallows of the Swan-Canning Estuary between the late 1970s and recent decades (Valesini et al., 2017). Another notable finding in the shallows of the basins, which was also identified by Potter et al. (2016) and further corroborated by the additional fish data collected in the Linkage study, is the return of abundant catches of various ‘weed-associated’ marine species since 2008, i.e. Western gobbleguts, Ostorhinchus rueppellii, Soldier fish Gymnapistes marmoratus and Western striped grunter Pelates octolineatus (Supplementary Materials S9.3). These species were also abundant in 1979-1983 when large blooms of green macroalgae blanketed Peel Inlet (Loneragan et al., 1986; Potter et al., 1983b). Their return in recent decades is likely to be related to the increases in seagrass and, in the southern Harvey Estuary, green macroalgae, that have been recorded over the same time frame (Chapter 7). With respect to how these changes in the fish community have impacted the ecological health of the estuary, the main drivers of the improved FCI in the shallows of the rivers over the last few decades are the feeding, habitat and estuary usage guilds of the most dominant fish species (see the shadeplot of the FCI metric scores in Fig. 9.5, where green to white shades indicate better scores and red to black shades indicate poorer scores). Since the mid-2000s, more of the species that now dominate the fish assemblage (e.g. the hardyheads L. wallacei and A. elongata; Supplementary Materials S9.4) have specialist feeding strategies and/or are able to spawn in the estuary (i.e. metric trends which lead to increases in the FCI; see Table 9.2). In contrast, several of the more abundant species in the late 1970s (e.g. Perth herring and Yellowtail grunter Amniataba caudavittata) have generalist or opportunistic feeding strategies, or feed mainly on detritus (i.e. metric trends which lead to decreases in the FCI). Interestingly, however, some metrics showed a tendency to decline in health from the late 1970s to more recent periods. These included the prevalence of bottom-dwelling (benthic) fish, both in terms of the number of species and proportion of fish in the assemblage (although the latter also performed poorly in the early 1980s), as well as the overall number of fish species (Fig. 9.5). Another feature of the longer-term trends in the FCI is the greater inter-seasonal and inter-annual variability in the late 1970s/early 1980s compared to later decades (Fig. 9.4). This is very likely related to the far greater river inflows during that period, especially compared to the last decade. For example, the obvious drop in the FCI in winter 1981 to very poor (E) in both the rivers and basins (Fig. 9.4a), coincided with large flows from the Murray River compared to those in other sampling years in that period, i.e. 1979, 1980 or 1982 (F. Valesini et al., 2019). Such large winter flushes often displace fish downstream (or out to sea), leading to low catches. The massive summer blooms of the toxic blue-green algae Nodularia spumigena in the Harvey Estuary in the 1970s/80s almost certainly would have further contributed to the observed variability in the FCI, particularly in the basins. Dense blooms of this microalgae, combined with related impacts such as deoxygenation of the water column as the blooms collapse, are well known to negatively impact the fish fauna in the estuary (Potter et al., 1983a). Further evidence of these impacts was that while the basin FCI was often highest in summer in sampling periods after the Cut (i.e. those from 1996 onwards), this was rarely the case in the pre-Cut periods (Fig. 9.4a).  Figure 9.4: Trends in mean Fish Community Index (FCI) scores and corresponding ecological health grades in the shallow nearshore waters from 1979-2018 in (a) the rivers and basins and (b) the Peel-Harvey Estuary as a whole. The dashed lines of corresponding colour represent the line of best fit through the data. Figure 9.5: Shadeplot of the average FCI metric scores in the shallows of the (a) basins and (b) rivers in each sampling year and season (S, summer; A, autumn; W, winter; SP, spring) from 1979–2018. Metric scores are shown on a coloured spectrum from red/black (poor scores) to green/white (excellent scores). The ecological health of the deeper waters has declined over the last 40 years In contrast to the trends in the shallows, the average condition of the deeper waters has worsened over the last 40 years (Fig. 9.6). This was especially so in the basins, which have declined from a good health status (B) in the 1970s/80s to fair/poor (C/D) in 2016–18 (Fig. 9.6a). The rivers have also declined, but only slightly from an average of C/D to D/C. The health trends in the deeper basins clearly reflect a shift in the fish fauna from one that was relatively species-rich, abundant and contained proportionately more benthic-dwelling and/or estuarine individuals (all of which positively influence the FCI; see Table 9.2), to one that is comparatively depauperate (with no fish being caught on several sampling occasions), sporadic and dominated by marine species (Fig. 9.7; Supplementary Materials S9.5). In the 1970s/80s, catches were regularly dominated by Estuary cobbler (which is able to spawn in the estuary and is also bottom-dwelling), other benthic-associated species such as Mulloway Argyrosomus japonicus, Roach Gerres subfasciatus, Yellow-finned whiting Sillago schomburgkii and Western striped grunter. Tailor Pomatomus saltatrix, and Yellow-eye mullet Aldrichetta forsteri were also abundant (Supplementary Materials S9.5). In 2016-18, however, catches were sparser and dominated only in particular seasons by Tailor, Australian herring Arripis georgianus, Southern eagle rays Myliobatis tenuicaudatus and Weeping toadfish, all of which are marine species. One metric that did show improvements from the earliest to latest sampling period was the proportion of fish feeding on detritus, but this mainly reflected the lower catches of Sea mullet Mugil cephalus in 2016-18 (Fig. 9.7; Supplementary Materials S9.5).  The reasons for the decline in health in the basins are unclear, though may partly reflect the substantial decline in green macroalgae from the 1970s to 2018, especially in Peel Inlet (see Chapter 7). Macroalgae provides abundant food and shelter for several of the above fish species, which are well known to be weed-associated, e.g. Estuary cobbler and Western striped grunter. Additionally, given that many of the fish species abundant in the earlier period feed on bottom-dwelling invertebrates, their decline over time may also reflect the poor health of those invertebrate fauna in the deeper basin sediments that we recorded in other parts of the research (see Chapter 8). While there are no available data on the full invertebrate community in the deeper basins from the 1970s/80s, evidence from the shallows shows an obvious decline in these fauna from the mid-1980s to mid-2000s (M. Wildsmith et al., 2009). It is also possible that due to greater water clarity in the basins with the greater tidal influx since the Dawesville Cut, the gill nets used to sample fish in the deeper waters may be more visible and thus more easily avoided. Lastly, fishing pressure impacts on key fishery species such as Estuary Cobbler, Mulloway and Yellow-finned whiting cannot be discounted. Nonetheless, it is notable that the health of the deeper waters in the rivers has generally been poorer than those in the basins over the last 40 years. This mirrors the situation in the Swan-Canning Estuary (Hallett, 2018), and probably reflects the greater vulnerability of these deeper areas to low dissolved oxygen conditions. Such ‘hypoxia’ is typically worse at the bottom of the water column given it is often related to salinity stratification, where saltier, denser waters fall to the bottom and are overlain by fresher, lighter water. It is also linked to poor river flushing, as waters retained in the estuary for long periods of time become depleted of oxygen due to consumption by biota and other biogeochemical processes. Both the stratification and flushing of the rivers are anticipated to worsen in coming decades given projections for further drying of the climate (Huang et al., 2019a). Figure 9.6: Trends in mean Fish Community Index (FCI) scores and corresponding ecological health grades in the deeper waters from 1979-2018 in (a) the rivers (orange lines) and basins (blue lines) and (b) the Peel-Harvey Estuary as a whole. The dashed lines of corresponding colour represent the line of best fit through the data. Figure 9.7: Shadeplot of the average FCI metric scores in the deeper waters of the (a) basins and (b) rivers in each sampling year and season (S, summer; A, autumn; W, winter; SP, spring) from 1979-2018. Metric scores are shown on a coloured spectrum from red/black (poor scores) to green/white (excellent scores). Interpretation of long-term trends in estuary health is hampered by inconsistencies in sampling approach among historical studies The above interpretations of the longer-term trends in the ecological health of the estuary should be considered indicative only, given the potential influence on the FCI of the differences in fish sampling methods over the last 40 years (see Table 9.1). While this historical fish community data set is the best available for the Peel-Harvey Estuary, and has been standardised as far as possible to minimize the effects of sampling differences (see section 9.4.1.1), it is inevitable that some legacy effects will remain. For example, fish in the shallows were sampled using far larger seine nets with bigger mesh sizes in the early periods, compared to the smaller and finer-meshed nets used in recent periods. These net differences invariably impact the ‘catchability’ of different fish species that may be present, given differences such as the extent from shore that can be fished, the speed with which a net can be retrieved, the efficiency with which different sections of the water column are fished, and which fish species can escape through the mesh. Hallett and Hall (2012) experimentally tested the efficiency with which the large (102 m) and small (21 m) seine nets used over the last 40 years in the Peel-Harvey caught different guilds of fish. They found, for example, that the larger net typically catches fewer of the smaller species and especially in the rivers (where the steeper banks reduce its fishing efficiency), yet often returns more species per haul given the potentially broader habitats it can reach. Differences between the gill nets used to sample the deeper waters in the 1970s/80s compared to more recent periods may have also impacted the comparability of those fish data sets. For example, gill nets used in the earlier period were a combination of floating and sunken nets, while those in recent sampling periods were only sunken nets and may have sampled pelagic species less effectively. Additionally, whereas nets were set for three hours in the 1970s–1980s, they could only be set for one hour in the more recent period given revised regulatory requirements and ethical considerations. While we have standardised both data sets to numbers of fish caught per hour, nets left in the water for longer periods simply have a greater likelihood of catching a greater number of species if they are present. Although our data standardization methods can adjust for the effects of net biases on the abundances of any fish species that was caught, it is impossible to adjust the abundance of a species that was never caught in a given fish sample. That is, there is no way of knowing whether the failure of a net to catch a species was due to the net type, or to that species simply not being present. Moving forward, it is thus strongly recommended that to avoid these sampling biases, a standardised fish sampling approach is used for monitoring the ecological condition of the estuary into the future (see section 9.5.4). A consistent fish sampling regime to support FCI monitoring has been undertaken annually in the Swan-Canning Estuary since 2012, and continues to be supported by the Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions in that system (Chris S. Hallett et al., 2019a). A similar approach has also been adopted in the Walpole-Nornalup Estuary by the Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development (‘Fisheries’) since 2017 (Yeoh et al., 2019). 9.5.2 Current ecological condition of the Peel-Harvey Estuary (2016-18) The current overall health of the Peel-Harvey Estuary is fair to poor More detailed analysis of the FCI in each region and sampling season between autumn 2016 and summer 2018 showed that, on average, the overall health of the estuary in both the shallow and deeper waters was fair to poor (C–D; see grades in larger circles in Figs @ref(fig:fish-ecology-pic12 and 9.9). Overall estuary condition was consistently best during autumn in both years and water depths (grade C), while the poorest grades were found in winter 2016 and spring 2017 in both water depths (grade D). In general, health grades were typically better in several of the basin regions than they were in one or more of the river regions. However, this was not a consistent trend, with regional patterns varying considerably among sampling occasions and water depths. For example, the shallow upper Murray River was in good to very good health (A–B) in autumn and spring 2017 and summer 2018, while the rest of the estuary was in fair to very poor health (C–E; Fig. 9.8. Further exploration of the complexity of these patterns in both the shallow and deeper waters is given below. Accompanying shadeplots of the metric scores in each region and sampling occasion are also provided for the shallows in Fig. @ref(fig:fish-ecology-pic14 and deeper waters in Fig. 9.11. In the deeper basins, the northern Harvey Estuary and Peel Inlet is often in better ecological health than the southern Harvey Estuary Good to fair ecological health was commonly recorded in the deeper waters of the northern Harvey Estuary, western Peel Inlet and to a lesser extent the eastern Peel Inlet, whereas the deeper southern Harvey Estuary was often in fair to poor health; (Fig. 9.9). The higher FCI grades often reflected the presence of more species, as well as more trophic specialists and/or fewer detritivores in some seasons and/or regions (Fig. 9.10). Thus, while several species such as Tailor, Australian herring and Weeping toadfish were commonly caught across all basin regions, there were multiple marine species caught in the northern Harvey and Peel Inlet regions that were never or rarely caught in the southern Harvey, e.g. Black stingray Bathytoshia lata, Western shovelnose ray Aptychotrema vincentiana, Rock flathead Platycephalus laevigatus, Western Australian salmon A. truttaceus and King George whiting Sillaginodes punctata (shadeplots not shown). This undoubtedly reflects the ready access from the ocean to those northern basin regions via the Dawesville and/or natural entrance channels, as well as the more stable, marine salinities in particularly the western Peel Inlet and northern Harvey Estuary. Perth herring, which is a detritivore, was relatively abundant across the Harvey Estuary in some seasons, which in part probably reflects the high sedimentary organic matter levels throughout the deeper parts of that basin (C. S. Hallett et al., 2019). However, it was proportionally more abundant in the southern Harvey, which would have contributed to the lower FCI scores recorded in that region. These findings may be indicative of the extensive green macroalgal growths that occur in the southern Harvey (F. J. Valesini et al., 2019), and hence the abundant food sources for detritus-feeding fish species.  In the deeper rivers, the upper Murray appears to be in chronically poor ecological health, while the Serpentine River is often in fair to good health The condition of the deeper waters of the upper Murray region was poor (D) in six of the eight sampling seasons, and never better than fair (C; Fig. 9.9. This commonly reflected the low number and diversity of species, low numbers of species with specialist feeding strategies, dominance of species feeding on detritus (detritivores) and relatively low representation by species that spawn in the estuary (see metric scores in Fig. 9.10. In most seasons, the fish community of this region was represented by just two or three species, the most abundant of which was Sea mullet (a detritivore that spawns in marine waters), followed by Black bream (a highly opportunistic omnivore) and Perth herring (also a detritivore; shadeplots not shown). Additionally, concurrent work on Black bream, which is a prized species targeted by recreational fishers that inhabits the riverine reaches of estuaries, has shown that its current population status in the Peel-Harvey is vulnerable. This is due to both very poor recruitment of juveniles into the stock since 2010, as well as low catches of adult fish above the State minimum legal length for capture of 250 mm (A. Cottingham, unpublished data). The virtual absence of these juveniles from the shallows of the rivers where they typically reside is reflected in Supplementary Materials S9.4, and contrasts with the higher numbers recorded in the previous sampling period in 2005–2007. Similarly, the abundance of larger fish in the deeper rivers has also declined from the previous 2013–2014 sampling period to the current one (Supplementary Materials S9.6), and a substantial number of the larger Black bream caught in 2016–2018 were in the lower Murray or Serpentine River (shadeplot not shown). The poor ecological health of the deeper waters in the upper Murray likely reflects their susceptibility to stratification of the water column, and the persistent low dissolved oxygen conditions that develop as a result. The high levels of organic matter that accumulate in the deeper waters of this region (Chris S. Hallett et al., 2019a) also accelerate the biological consumption of oxygen in the bottom waters. From summer to winter 2017 and again in summer 2018, the salinity at the water surface was 12-24 units fresher than at the bottom, and there was close to no dissolved oxygen in the bottom waters (concentrations of  &lt;1 mg L‑1) on all four sampling occasions. A major fish kill event (&gt;10,000 fish) occurred in the Murray River during this period (summer 2017), triggered by an unseasonally high rainfall event and the extensive hypoxia/anoxia that developed as a result (see below). While the most visible impact of these events is on larger fish (with many dead Black bream observed; C. Hallett, pers. obs., and photo above), the impacts on earlier life stages and small fish are less obvious. In the case of Black bream, given that its typical spawning period (late spring-summer, Sarre and Potter, 1999) coincides not only with the acute episode in summer 2017, but also with the chronic stratification and hypoxia that develops at that time of year, it is very possible that its decline in the Peel-Harvey is due to the mortality of its eggs and/or young larvae under these conditions.   In contrast to the deeper waters, the ecological health of the shallow upper Murray was good to very good in several seasons (autumn and spring 2017 and summer 2018; Fig. 9.8, which often reflected a prevalence of species with specialist feeding strategies, low contributions by detritivores, and low contributions by the indicator species Pseudogobius olorum (Fig. 9.10. These good metric scores were mainly driven by several smaller fish species that feed on small animals near the sediment surface (i.e. zoobenthivores), most of which have freshwater affinities, e.g. Southwestern goby A. suppositus, Western minnow Galaxias occidentalis, Western pygmy perch Edelia vittata, Mosquito fish Gambusia holbrooki (shadeplots not shown).  Also in contrast to the deeper upper Murray, the deeper waters of the Serpentine River were in fair to good ecological health for five of the eight sampling occasions (Fig. 9.9. This was due mainly to good scores for metrics such as more specialist feeders rather than generalist feeders or detritivores, more bottom-dwelling species, and more species able to spawn in the estuary (Fig. 9.11). Its fish fauna was often characterised by marine-associated zoobenthivore or zooplanktivore species such as Tarwhine, Yellow-finned whiting, Roach and Southern anchovy, several of which are also benthic-associated. Commonly occurring estuarine-spawning species included Black bream and also Anchovy (shadeplots not shown). The better health of the deeper waters of the Serpentine likely reflects the shallower and more consistent depth of this river (with fewer deep holes where organic matter can accumulate), and its less variable and more marine salinities. In particular, the Serpentine River rarely exhibits the marked salinity stratification and associated hypoxia found in the upper Murray (unpublished data). The FCI successfully tracked the ecological impacts of the summer 2017 flood event On the 10th of February 2017, the Perth Metro area received a daily total of 114.4 mm of rain, its second highest daily fall for any month from records going back to 1876 (Meteorology, 2017). The high river flows that followed created fresh conditions throughout the Murray River and delivered an enormous quantity of organic matter from the surrounding catchments into the estuary (see adjacent photo). This was evident as a 10cm-thick layer of organic-rich silt and cow faeces during fish sampling in the lower Murray River on 16 February 2017 (pers. obs.). The combination of this organic loading and the highly stratified water column that became established in the following weeks and months led to severe hypoxia throughout the Murray River.  During this period, both the shallow and deeper waters of the lower Murray region were in poor to very poor health, reflecting that either no fish were caught at all (deeper waters), or that the fish fauna contained only a limited number of species with ecological traits that decreased the FCI (shallows). Indeed the slightly higher grades in the shallows appeared to be artificially inflated by some larger species which normally inhabit the deeper waters of the lower Murray coming up on the banks to seek refuge (e.g. Tarwhine), and some species which normally occupy the more upstream river reaches being flushed down (e.g. the Southwestern goby). Another goby species which was relatively abundant in the shallows was the Blue-spot goby, which can tolerate silty substrates and survive hypoxic conditions through its capacity to ‘breathe air’ at the water surface (Gee and Gee, 1991). This ‘indicator’ species represents two metrics in the shallow-water FCI (Table 9.2, and its relative abundance would have contributed to the poor ecological health recorded in summer 2017. As well as tracking the immediate ecological health impacts of the flood in the lower Murray, the FCI also tracked impacts in adjoining regions such as the eastern Peel Inlet and Serpentine River. While the deeper waters of both of those regions were in ‘good’ health (grade B) in summer 2017 (Fig. 9.9, this was likely due in part to either the displacement of fish flushed out of the Murray River, or fish that were actively seeking refuge from inhospitable conditions. Tailor, for example, which was caught in the lower Murray in the warmer seasons of 2016–2018, was recorded for the only time in the Serpentine River in summer 2017 and was also relatively abundant in the eastern Peel Inlet. Similarly, Roach, which was frequently abundant in the lower Murray but less so in the Serpentine, became most abundant in that latter region in summer 2017. Tarwhine, which had also been abundant in the lower Murray in warmer seasons, became relatively abundant in the eastern Peel and to a lesser extent the Serpentine in summer 2017, then also returned to being abundant in the lower Murray in autumn 2017 (shadeplots not shown). These findings provide good evidence that the FCI is a sensitive indicator of ecological health shifts due to environmental perturbations such as acute hypoxic events. The ecological health of the shallow nearshore waters is inconsistent among regions, seasons and years It was difficult to discern many clear trends in the ecological health of the shallow waters (Fig. 9.8). Considerable variability has also been observed in the nearshore FCI scores in the Swan-Canning Estuary (Chris S. Hallett et al., 2019a), but generally less so than in the Peel-Harvey. The high variability in the shallows may in part reflect the fact that the bulk of the fish fauna are small, highly-schooling species (such as Hardyheads, Sandy sprat and Weeping toadfish) that can be caught either in very large numbers or virtually not at all, depending on whether a school is intercepted. The particularly shallow waters across large parts of the Peel-Harvey basins, where depths of &lt;0.5 m often extend a considerable distance from shore, may further contribute to the erratic nature of catches. For example, water quality conditions such as temperature can change quickly in the very shallow waters, and fish are also highly susceptible to predation by other fish or birds. One surprising trend that was relatively consistent in the shallows was the regularly poor to sometimes very poor ecological health recorded in the Mandurah Entrance Channel (Fig. 9.8. This well-flushed and essentially marine region, which is a conduit for many marine species moving between the estuary and the ocean, was expected to mainly be in good ecological health. However, it often scored poorly for metrics such as number of species and contributions by species that are benthic, specialist feeders and/or estuarine (Fig. 9.10. However, given that the reference or ‘benchmark’ conditions for the FCI metrics are (i) tailored to each estuary region and season and (ii) based on all available historical data (see section 9.4.1.2), examination of the fish community recorded in the Mandurah Channel over the full data record revealed some key reasons for the comparatively poor scores in 2016-2018. Several species which are specialist feeders, estuarine-spawners and/or bottom-dwelling, have dropped markedly in abundance from the 1970s/80s to more recent periods, e.g. Long-finned goby, Bridled goby, Small-toothed flounder and Sandy sprat (shadeplots not shown). Additionally Weeping toadfish, which are opportunistic omnivores, now make up a greater proportion of the fish assemblage than they did 40 years ago. The average number of species caught per sampling occasion has also declined progressively over time, from ~17 species in the 1970s/80s to ~7 in 2016-2018.  While some of these trends may be influenced by differences in sampling regimes from the earlier to later periods (see subsection 9.5.1), the declines of several species that prefer sandy substrates (Long-finned goby and Small-toothed flounder) or seagrass (Bridled goby) could also reflect degradation of the channel environment from greater siltation and/or loss of key habitat. One obvious development between the 1970s/80s and more recent decades is the construction of the housing canals that now branch off and drain into the entrance channel, and which may have contributed to localised habitat changes.

NB condition assessments missing for some regions in first two seasons due to sampling issues. 9.5.3 Relating estuary condition to modelled environmental changes Bottom water age, dissolved oxygen and salinity have the greatest impact on ecological health When FCI scores were correlated with a suite of environmental variables, bottom water age, dissolved oxygen content and salinity were shown to have the greatest influence on ecological condition in the estuary (see Supplementary Materials S9.7 for GAM model descriptions). This correlation was strongest in the deeper waters of the rivers, where the best ecological condition occurred when water age was between 50 and 100 days (though it declined when water age exceeded 100 days) and when dissolved oxygen content was highest (Fig. 9.12). Thus, the poorest ecological condition occurred at water ages of &lt; 50 days and when dissolved oxygen content was low (&lt;2 mg/L). While this finding for water age may initially seem unusual, it reflects the fact that during high freshwater flow events with relatively continuous flow (very low water age) marine-associated fish species (e.g. Tarwhine, Tailor, Giant herring, Mulloway) are flushed downstream to more saline areas, thereby negatively influencing several FCI metrics (e.g. no. trophic specialist, no. species, Shannon-Weiner diversity) and resulting in decreased FCI scores.  The robustness of this best-fit GAM model was tested by comparing actual FCI scores collected during 2017–2018, with those predicted based on the modelled environmental data during those sampling events. Observed and predicted scores were significantly correlated (Pearson R = 0.6, P &lt; 0.05) and, for 10 of the 12 sampling occasions, predicted the same FCI grade or overlapped the range of observed FCI scores (Fig. 9.13. One downside of the GAMs model, however, was that it generally over predicted FCI scores and so did not predict very low scores (i.e. grade E) very well (Fig. 9.13.  In the shallow waters of the estuary, correlations between FCI scores and environmental variables were weaker, although salinity and the area of hypoxic waters (percentage of the region with dissolved oxygen content &lt; 2 mg L-1) were shown to significantly influence ecological health in the rivers and basins, respectively. In the rivers, increasing salinity had a weak positive effect on FCI scores, while in the basins, hypoxia area had a weak negative influence. No significant correlation between ecological condition and the tested environmental variables was detected in the deeper waters of the basins.  This study represents the first time FCI scores and environmental variables (observed or model-derived) have been incorporated into statistical models to predict ecological health. Although the correlations were weak in some estuarine regions, the findings in the deeper waters of the rivers highlight the potential of this statistical modelling approach to predict future ecological condition in this vulnerable part of the estuary. More research is required to further explore the reasons underlying the poorer correlations in other parts of the estuary.

These options have been based on the outcomes of the current study, and informed by the design of a comparable ongoing monitoring regime in the Swan-Canning Estuary (Hallett and Valesini, 2012). They include varying levels of spatial and temporal replication, depending on resource availability and monitoring objectives. Each of these options could (and should) be further tailored for purpose prior to implementation.  9.5.5 Proposed options for a fish and FCI monitoring regime in the Peel Harvey Estuary Three options are presented below for a future fish and FCI monitoring regime in the Peel-Harvey Estuary, based on the outcomes of the current study and informed by the design of a comparable, ongoing monitoring regime in the Swan-Canning Estuary (Hallett and Valesini, 2012). These options are summarized in Table 9.3 and Fig. 9.7.1, and are accompanied by indicative costs of implementation (i.e. time, resources and funding, based on an assumption that all field sampling and laboratory processing would be conducted by personnel from within the university sector). Note that estimated costs are based on approximate multipliers of those for the FCI monitoring and reporting program in the Swan-Canning Estuary, and should be considered indicative only; Fully costed budgets would be required before implementing any of these monitoring options. 9.5.5.1 Option 1 – optimal spatial and temporal replication Power analyses were conducted for the Swan-Canning Estuary fish community data to establish the required sampling intensity for an ongoing monitoring regime (Hallett and Valesini, 2012). These analyses indicated that a future regime should employ a minimum sampling intensity of six sites per estuary region to provide an adequate level of replication for detecting statistically significant changes in ecological condition. Moreover, other analyses have previously identified summer and autumn to be the optimum period in which to implement the FCI, and have indicated that any future monitoring regime should include both summer and autumn sampling, given that the condition of the estuary may change between seasons (e.g. in response to the occurrence of algal blooms in one or more seasons; Hallett and Valesini, 2012). Option 1 for a future FCI monitoring program for the Peel-Harvey is based on a comparable level of spatial and temporal replication (Table 3). This option is considered ‘optimal’ in the sense of maximizing the statistical robustness of monitoring outputs and the ability to quantify and interpret any seasonal change in estuary condition within the monitoring period for a particular year. This has important implications for understanding and communicating the effects of e.g. harmful algal blooms or periods of hypoxia on estuary condition in any given year (Hallett et al., 2016). However, the resulting sampling regime is labour intensive and therefore costly to implement, relative to options 2 and 3. Furthermore, the increased numbers of sampling sites increase the potential impacts of FCI monitoring on fish populations in the system. 9.5.5.2 Option 2 – reduced spatial replication Option 2 scales back the spatial intensity of sampling (and particularly of that of the deeper waters) within each estuary region, to reduce the costs of implementation of a future monitoring and reporting program. Reducing the numbers of deeper sites sampled within a region in any season (from six to three) effectively halves the total time required to complete the monitoring, as a maximum of three gill net sites may be sampled in any one night, given safety and logistical constraints (Table 9.4). This level of spatial replication of sampling effectively mirrors that employed under the recent ARC Linkage project. It likely represents the most cost-effective option for a future monitoring and reporting regime, if robust statistical testing of differences in condition among regions is not the primary goal of the monitoring program. 9.5.5.3 Option 3 – reduced temporal replication Option 3 scales back the temporal intensity of sampling from two to one season per year (Table 9.4), to reduce the costs of implementation of a future monitoring and reporting program. In doing so, there is a risk that conditions during the sampling season are not representative of those observed more broadly during the year: there is no temporal context for interpreting the annual snapshot of condition. 9.5.5.4 Other potential modifications to the proposed monitoring regime The implementation costs associated with a future monitoring regime could conceivably be reduced further by alterations to the proposed design, although it is crucial to note that such changes would likely reduce the robustness and utility of the index. Nonetheless, several potential modifications to the proposed design are outlined in Table 9.5, along with the practical, financial and science/management implications of these changes.

Fully costed budgets are required before implementing any of these monitoring options.

Circles denote shallow (red) and deeper (yellow) sampling sites. 9.5.6 Broad overview of reporting approach The shallow and deeper water FCIs could provide a key tool for surveillance monitoring of the condition of the Peel-Harvey Estuary and of each of its component regions, as they do for the Swan-Canning Estuary (Hallett et al., 2019a). Surveillance monitoring aims to assess and track long-term and/or broad-scale changes in ecosystem condition and enables the reporting and communication of patterns and trends in ecosystem condition to the public and other stakeholders. The ways in which indicator results are presented, communicated and interpreted will thus in part determine the success and value of any future program for monitoring and reporting estuary condition. FCI scores should be calculated from the collected fish community monitoring data and may be reported to the public and stakeholders via e.g. mapping and trend plots, as detailed in Hallett (2018). In particular, the reporting and communication of results from the FCI monitoring program should include mean index scores (0–100) along with a measure of their variability (e.g. standard error of the mean), and the accompanying condition grades (A–E). In doing so, the condition of the Peel-Harvey Estuary as a whole should be considered and reported alongside that of its individual regions. Spatial mapping of index results enables the comparison of ecosystem condition between estuary regions, and thus enables managers to determine which areas of the estuary may be most in need of management intervention. These indices also provide a method for tracking the condition of the system over time. If negative trends in estuary condition over time exceed manager-defined limits of acceptable change, monitoring results could then be acted upon, for example via the implementation of restoration measures to improve ecosystem condition. Similarly, trends in ecological condition may also be presented for individual zones. Table 9.5: Potential modifications to the proposed monitoring options, and their associated benefits and costs. Modification Rationale/benefit Consequence/limitation ‘Option 4’: combines reduced spatial and temporal intensities as outlined for options 2 and 3. Minimises sampling costs of the monitoring. Lower statistical power to quantify the significance of any changes in estuary condition. - Lacks context of any seasonal changes in estuary condition. Conduct monitoring and reporting only every two years. Halving of financial costs associated with collecting and processing samples. Impaired ability to detect and interpret trends in estuary condition over time. Restrict monitoring and reporting of estuary condition to shallow waters only. Considerable savings in time and financial costs (entire estuary could be sampled in ~3-4 days). Inability to correctly interpret changes in shallow index scores, given the resulting lack of knowledge of adjacent, deeper waters. - Incomplete assessment of estuarine condition. Restrict monitoring and reporting of estuary condition to the riverine regions only (i.e. Serpentine, Lower Murray, Upper Murray). Most of the severe ecological problems are evident in the riverine regions (algal blooms, fish kills etc). - Considerable savings in time and financial costs. Incomplete assessment of estuarine condition. 9.6 Conclusions The ecological health of the estuary has generally declined over the last 40 years, and is currently in a fair to poor state overall While the basins of the estuary are often perceived to be in ‘good’ condition following the Dawesville Cut and the resulting increase in tidal flushing and decline in algal blooms, the fish faunal trends in the deeper waters indicate otherwise. While they have certainly become more marine-influenced, they are also less diverse, less abundant, more sporadic and less specialised in their habitat requirements, and have declined from good overall health in the 1970s–1980s to fair/poor health in 2016–18. The current, overarching health of the estuary in both the shallow and deeper waters is fair to poor, relative to previously-recorded benchmark conditions. While there is considerable variability among regions and seasons, especially in the very shallow waters, the average ecological signal reflects an ecosystem under moderate to high levels of stress. The most impacted areas are the deeper waters of the upper Murray River and southern Harvey Estuary, and the shallows of the natural entrance channel The above areas currently appear to be in a chronically-stressed state and often exhibited poor to very poor ecological health via fish faunas that were either comparatively depauperate or dominated by a small number of species with less desirable ecological traits, e.g. opportunistic or detritus feeders. The ecological health signals from the fish communities align with those of the benthic invertebrate and macrophyte communities in the upper Murray and/or southern Harvey Estuary (Cronin-O’Reilly et al., 2019; F. J. Valesini et al., 2019). The convergence of each of these biotic indices, which each reflect different (albeit inter-related) aspects of estuarine structure and function, provides compelling evidence that the ecological health of those areas is under significant threat. Spatio-temporal patterns in FCI scores and grades reflect key environmental drivers Persistent bottom-water hypoxia and high organic matter loadings in the upper Murray are likely to be main drivers of consistently poor FCI scores, as are the relative lack of flushing and high organic loadings in the southern Harvey Estuary.  It is predicted that low oxygen conditions in the Murray River will become more persistent in the future (see Chapters 3 &amp; 4, which, given the above findings, would be expected to result in further ecological degradation.  Somewhat unexpectedly, substantial flushing in the rivers also caused a decline in FCI scores, which was likely due to avoidance of the area by marine-associated species and a resultant fish fauna comprised of only a few freshwater tolerant species (e.g. Sea mullet, Black bream).  The surprising trends in the natural entrance channel may reflect an increase in silty sediments and loss of habitat (e.g. seagrass or saltmarsh) since the 1970s, possibly linked to localised developments such as the adjoining housing canals. Establishing a regular fish monitoring regime is critical to assessing and tracking measures to improve ongoing ecological health The historical fish faunal data set available for the Peel-Harvey has provided a rare basis for establishing fish metric benchmarks and exploring ecological health trends over time. However, the substantial inconsistencies in fish sampling approaches lead to inevitable biases that are at best minimised and in some cases are impossible to overcome, and cannot be disentangled from the historical health trends presented in this report. Given the evidence presented in this report that the ecological health of the estuary is under stress, it is imperative that a consistent and regular fish monitoring program is continued to better assess its ongoing health into the future.  Various options for such a fish monitoring program, which can be tailored to suit, are provided in section 11 of this report. 9.7 Acknowledgements We are grateful to Dr Peter Coulson, Hannah Joss, Kieryn Graham, Chris Hill and Willem DeKlerk for their assistance with sampling and sample processing, and to the many researchers who shared their data from previous studies in this system.

The most significant period was between 2006 and 2011 with the region’s employment growth rate reaching 28.7%. It was then followed by an employment growth rate of 18.8 between 2011 and 2016. Over the same decade, the total Western Australian workforce increased from 936,130 people to 1,157,735 people. The proportion of Peel-Harvey’s workforce to that of Western Australia during the period increased by 1.1%, from approximately 4.5% to 5.6%. Competitive advantage In 2006, the highest employing industries in the Peel-Harvey Region by number of people and % of the total employment in the region were:  Manufacturing (6244, 14.7%)  Construction (5489, 13%)  Retail trade (5211,12.3%) In 2011, these three industries were still the ones with highest employment level and employment growth rate, however, the order changed with construction taking the lead:  Construction (7257, 13.3%) Manufacturing (7082, 13%) Retail trade (6116, 11.2%)  In 2016, construction and retail trade remained in the top three industries with the highest employment level and employment growth, however, manufacturing dropped out and was replaced by health care and social assistance:  Construction (7594, 11.8%),  Retail trade (6976, 10.8%)  Health care and social assistance (6817, 10.6%)  Between 2006 and 2011, agriculture declined from 1630 to 1391 people employed, or from 3.8% to 2.6% of the total workforce in Peel-Harvey. Between 2011 and 2016 it rebounded slightly in terms of raw numbers, but due to overall increase in Peel-Harvey’s workforce, this amounted to only 2.5% of the total employment in the region. Comparative advantage Over the full period between 2006 and 2016, the Peel Harvey region’s economy remained specialised in the following industries: manufacturing, construction, agriculture, retail trade and electricity, gas, water and waste services.  In 2011, the region became specialised in mining. By 2016, mining surpassed agriculture in the degree of specialisation for the region. The majority of all other industries in Peel-Harvey also grew in size between 2006 and 2016. However, there are some exceptions to this trend, which include: information, media and telecommunications which declined in the period from 2006 to 2011, but grew in the period from 2011 to 2016; and wholesale trade, which declined in the period from 2011 to 2016.  10.2 Background This research component forms part of an Australian Research Council Linkage Project LP150100451 (the ‘ARC Linkage Project’) aimed at understanding the relational dynamics of the ecological and socio-economic system(s) of the Peel-Harvey estuary and surrounding catchment areas (the ‘Peel-Harvey Region’). Two major challenges are predicted for the Peel-Harvey Region within the next 30 years: (i) a major increase in population growth, and (ii) a significant further drying and warming of the regional climate (F. Valesini et al., 2019). The need to get the right balance between development aspirations and estuarine health has never been more important. This research component focuses on understanding local competitiveness in the Peel-Harvey Region’s economic system.  This research uses the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Census of Population and Housing time series profiles, which count the number of persons in each industry of employment (based on place of enumeration) for all 138 local government areas (LGAs) in Western Australia for the census periods 2006, 2011 and 2016. The three most recent census periods have been selected as the most relevant for the purposes of this research (and due to lack of concordance in data collection methods for census periods prior to 2006). Boundaries for the LGAs of the Peel-Harvey Region – Boddington, Harvey, Mandurah, Murray, Waroona and Serpentine-Jarrahdale - are according to the ABS 2016 definition. To identify the key and strategic industries for each LGA, employment is disaggregated by industrial sector, as defined by the Australian and New Zealand Standard Industrial Classification (ANZSIC) industry coding (see Appendix 1). It should be noted that one limitation widely reported by local governments is the likely undercount of employees by the ABS. This arises out of the difficulty in capturing fly-in/fly-out workers and other temporary residents. In this research, place of usual residence data has been used.  The scope of the study is based on the political boundaries of the LGAs that ‘overlap’ the Peel-Harvey Estuary and primary catchment areas (see map at Appendix 3). The estuary, which covers approximately 130 km2, lies predominantly in the smallest of the nine formal planning regions for the State of Western Australia, the Peel Region. However, some of the 9,400 km2 of the three main river subcatchments of the estuary extend into part of the South West Region. Accordingly, there are five LGAs in the Peel Region, and one in the South West region, whose boundaries broadly ‘overlap’ those of the estuarine ecological system to form the ‘Peel-Harvey Region’ for the purposes of this study: Shire of Boddington (Peel) Shire of Harvey (South West) City of Mandurah (Peel) Shire of Murray (Peel) Shire of Serpentine-Jarrahdale (Peel) Shire of Waroona (Peel) 10.3 Objectives The objective of this research component is to undertake an investigation of the Competitive Advantage and Comparative Advantage of the Peel-Harvey Region economy.  This links with the broader research objectives: To construct a simple model with which to conduct scenario analysis on the impacts of ecological and/or socio-economic changes in the Peel-Harvey Region. To link the model of competitive and comparative advantage across the Peel-Harvey Region to an ecological land use model that is being developed through the ARC Linkage Project as a tool to inform planning &amp; development decisions. 10.4 Approach Understanding “Local Competitiveness” and “Comparative Advantage” Cities and regions compete with each other for global, national, and local ‘market share’. The drivers that shape local economies encompass both the impacts of globalisation, technological, and environmental change and local geographical conditions. Furthermore, industries perform differently in particular locations and, not surprisingly, localities perform differently to each other. Some of those reasons include natural resources, geographic advantages, access to transport, energy or information networks, local policies and human capital. Human capital brings knowledge, skills and competencies which have a productive value. Housing, education, amenity and services all shape the availability and employability of human capital (Plammer and Taylor, 2001). The transition of the Western Australian economy from the mining investment boom to broader-based growth creates challenges to localities across the State, while bringing opportunities for growth and prosperity in others (Plummer et al., 2014). Policy and institutional settings will also impact local and regional capacity to respond to changes in economic, ecological and social conditions, and their dynamic interdependency. Building on the conceptual and empirical foundations of ‘New Regionalism’, we refer to recent government publications including a 2014 report published by the former Western Australian Department of Regional Development identifying the key drivers of local competitive and comparative advantage across the Western Australian economy (Development, 2014), and a more recent report published by the Australian Government Productivity Commission (Commission, 2017), identifying challenges that particular regions face in successfully transitioning from mining to a more sustainable economic base. In response to the identified ecological and demographic challenges being faced by the locations included in the ARC Linkage Project, this research component sets out the structure, dynamics, and competitiveness of the Peel-Harvey Region economy. 10.4.1 Local Competitive Advantage: the ability to create jobs locally The competitive advantage of a locality can be imputed, or calculated, from information on both the number of persons employed in each industry (‘size’) and those industries that are growing most rapidly in terms of their ability to create jobs relative to a benchmark economy (’growth’). Using the benchmark of the overall performance of the Western Australian economy, it is possible to categorize local industries as: Fast growing: relatively large sectors that have exhibited rapid recent growth. Restructuring: relatively large sectors that make a significant contribution to the economic base but with little or no growth over the recent past. Underdeveloped: low levels of activity in terms of employment and the contribution to the local economy. 10.4.2 Comparative Advantage: local economic specialization and interregional-trade patterns Conventionally it is assumed that localities specialize in those activities in which they have a comparative advantage. Comparative advantage is the principle that a country, region or locality should specialise in producing and exporting goods in which it has comparative or relative cost advantage over others, and import goods in which it has a cost disadvantage.  The comparative advantage of the Peel-Harvey Region is imputed using information on the importance of an industry in terms of the degree to which the local economy specializes in that economic activity (‘specialisation’) and a measure of the degree to which economic activity and employment is related to servicing local demand as against servicing demand external to the region (’economic base’). Determining the pattern of local economic specialisation using location quotients identifies the industries that drive and underpin the local economy (see Appendix 1). Location quotients (LQ) measure the concentration of an industry or economic activity in a particular location, compared to a benchmark economy, in this instance Western Australia. Typically, this is measured as the proportion of people employed in an industry in a locality relative to the proportion of people employed in that industry in the benchmark economy. If a particular industry’s share of regional employment is greater than that industry’s share of State employment, i.e. the location quotient is greater than one, (or unity), then the locality is assumed to specialize in that economic activity.  Since local economic data on trade flows does not exist, location quotients have also been widely used to infer regional trade patterns (see Appendix 2):  Basic sector: The greater the location quotient above one (or unity), the larger the economy’s net sectoral exports from that sector (i.e. the greater the proportion or share of the local economy of a particular industry, and therefore exports from that region). Non-basic sector: The greater the location quotient below unity (or one), the larger the economy’s net sectoral imports from that sector (i.e. the proportion or share of the local economy of a particular industry is less than the overall State proportion, and therefore imports into that region). Neutral sector: For a location quotient of unity, (or one), the economy is neither a net exporter nor a net importer for that sector. 10.4.3 Classifying Industrial Activities Combining the information on an economy’s ability to create jobs locally (Competitive Advantage) and identifying the patterns of specialization and inter-regional trade within sectors of the economy (Comparative Advantage), it is possible to classify industries in terms of their impact on the growth potential of a locality. Fig. 1 classifies the economic structure of a local economy with relative growth measured on the vertical axis and relative specialization measured on the horizontal axis: Important growth industries: characterized by above average employment growth, relative economic specialization, and export orientation. Important industries that may require attention: characterized by below average employment growth, relative economic specialization, and export orientation. Potential emergent industries: characterized by above average employment growth, but currently oriented towards servicing local demand. Industries of little promise: characterized by below average employment growth and currently oriented towards servicing local demand. Figure 10.1: Classification of Industrial Structure. 10.5 Main Findings Figs 2(a) and 2(b) summarise the economic structure of the Peel-Harvey economy: The Peel-Harvey economy is relatively diverse with six specialised industries, however, growth in each of these sectors was not consistent between 2006 and 2016. (The size of the ‘bubbles’ in Figure 2 relates to the relative size of the industry in terms of the number of people employed). Agriculture is important, especially by comparison to the Western Australian economy but overall does not employ a large number of people in Peel-Harvey compared with other industries.  The majority of other industry sectors, without further attention, will likely remain ’potential emergent industries’ from a local competition perspective. Although, promisingly, they all grew between 2006 and 2016. The exceptions to this trend, were: information, media and telecommunications which declined in the period from 2006 to 2011 to become an ‘industry of little promise’, but grew again in the period from 2011 to 2016, lifting its status to’potential emergent industry’; and wholesale trade, a ‘potential emergent industry’ in 2006 and 2011, but declined in the period from 2011 to 2016 and so classified as an’industry of little promise’.  In the 2006–2011 period, the only sector that showed both poor relative growth and limited specialisation in Peel-Harvey was information, media and telecommunications which was therefore designated an ‘industry of little promise’. While manufacturing, construction, retail trade, real estate (Rental, Hiring and Real Estate Services) and utilities (Electricity, Gas, Water and Waste Services) were the’important growth industries’ (based on relative growth and specialisation compared with the broader Western Australian economy). Agriculture, due to a decline in the number of people employed and ongoing comparative specialisation was identified as an ’important industry that may require attention’. In the 2011-2016 period, agriculture rebounded somewhat to reclaim its status as an ‘important growth industry’, and was joined in this quadrant by mining which grew more significantly in terms of employee numbers as well as becoming a specialisation for the Peel-Harvey Region. However, manufacturing while remaining a specialisation for the region, declined in size to become an’important industry that may require attention’. Information, media and telecommunications grew very slightly thereby ceasing to be in the ‘industry of little promise’ and transitioning to a’potential emergent industry’. Wholesale trade decreased in employee numbers over the same period leading it to change its status from ‘potential emergent industry’ to’industry of little promise’. Figure 10.2: The relative growth of the industry based on level of local specialization for 2006-2011. Figure 10.3: The relative growth of the industry based on level of local specialization for 2011-2016. 10.6 Conclusions The contemporary Western Australian economy can be characterized by a multi-speed economy, driven by a strong and consistent pattern of job creation that has not played out evenly across Western Australia. This has resulted in an increasingly ‘patchwork economy’, with larger and more economically diverse economies forging ahead of less resilient or smaller regions. Empirical analysis of both Comparative Advantage and Competitive Advantage provide valuable information on both existing and strengths and weaknesses of the Peel-Harvey region.  More broadly, Competitive Advantage and Comparative Advantage are technically two separate concepts which measure different dimensions of economic performance. However, when viewed together they have the potential to provide information on: Multiple factors in the economy of a particular place; The relationship of a particular locality with other localities nearby;  The interdependence between industries; and  The performance of that economy compared to other local economies.  This research component unpacks the growth experience of the Peel-Harvey Region. The dynamics and drivers of local competitiveness and comparative advantage shape a regional economy’s responsiveness to externalities and help explain the underlying forces triggering ‘catch-up’, ‘falling behind’ and ‘forging ahead’. They also assist in forecasting economic impacts including: The direct and indirect effect of investing in the region,  The influence of local investment beyond the region,  The potential for diffusion of external shocks across the economic system, and The potential significance of ecological change and/or environmental policy on the relative competitiveness of the local economy.

The framework reported is used to assess a series of scenarios that were designed after a stakeholder consultation process. These scenarios represented alternate future (2050) “storylines” that depicted different estuary health states, catchment development and management approaches and climate conditions for the Peel-Harvey system. These diverse views were synthesised into three main narratives (referred to as ‘environmentally optimistic’, ‘business as usual’ and ‘environmentally pessimistic’) and translated into coupled catchment-estuary model simulations. A range of novel environmental and economic indicators were then employed to assess the scenarios relative to a ‘base case’ (current conditions). From an environmental point of view, the scenarios tested show the overwhelming influence of a future dry climate on the flow of water to the estuary. While flows and nutrient loads are reduced, the flow-weighted nutrient concentrations remained fairly constant between matched land use scenarios that were subject to the two different climatic conditions. Catchment management actions were able to reduce the nutrients entering the estuary, with the most “environmentally optimistic” scenario able to reduce flow-weighted nitrogen by 24% and flow-weighted phosphorus by 69% compared to current conditions. The effect of climate change and land-use change for each scenario were compared by assessing the resulting differences in a range of water quality and ecosystem health indices. These indices also highlighted the relatively large change brought about by climate change (including sea level rise and catchment drying) into the future, which has the potential to significantly alter aspects of estuary condition, particularly on the eastern side of the basins and into the riverine reaches. Whilst some indices reported future benefits in some regions, overall the predictions indicated a more stressed system into the future and particularly exacerbated problems with hypoxia and harmful algal blooms in the rivers. The environmentally optimistic scenario did highlight, however, the potential benefit of sound catchment management on reducing negative impacts on the estuary and can help the adaptation process towards a drier future. The detailed model outputs are extensive and can be used to assist understanding of local changes and prioritise monitoring and management strategies. The scenarios were also assessed in terms of economic health. The framework for assessing economic health indicators is based on outputs from an econometrics model used to assess the historical and current regional job growth data. As such, the economic assessment did not seek to model long-term economic activity of individual sectors, but rather to provide a “systems view” of whether proposed stressors or actions would enhance economic specialisation, industry-linkages and job growth. Core indicators assessed for each scenario were therefore related to the comparative and competitive advantage of the regional economy, and a qualitative assessment of each indicator was made. To provide a holistic view of the relative environmental and economic status of each scenario, a further framework for supporting high-level decision-making was developed, able to link the varied drivers, pressures, actions, impacts and responses with locally relevant environmental quality and economic resilience indicators. The framework was applied to the three main stakeholder-led scenarios to demonstrate the trade-offs of decisions in a logical and transparent way. The assessment of the chosen scenarios highlights that actions to manage the health of the estuary can support long-term economic resilience by increasing export orientation and diversification. The newly developed framework shows potential for more widespread adoption for harmonising adaptation strategies between organisations by providing a common assessment approach for managing future risks. Further effort is required to operationalise the system in consultation with stakeholders. 11.2 Background People and estuaries are inextricably linked. These productive, safe and striking environments have long been attractive places to settle or visit for the vast societal benefits they provide, such as food, protection, environmental buffering, lifestyles, livelihoods and connection to place. However, exploitation of their resources and the vast downstream impacts of over-development of their catchments has led to estuaries becoming among the most degraded of all aquatic ecosystems, in turn threatening societal health in their vicinity and beyond. This close and reciprocal connection necessitates a socio-ecological view of these complex ecosystems, with the central question being how do we best maintain the benefits provided by healthy estuaries, while also meeting the needs of our growing populations and developing potential to grow economic opportunities? Successfully striking a balance or acceptable tradeoffs for the above question is a global issue, yet the pathways to achieving it are often poorly understood, rarely defined and seldom quantified. In part, this reflects the complexities and unpredictability of both estuaries and societies across multiple scales. It also reflects the fact that management of socio-ecological systems requires long-term thinking, yet the future is uncertain and our ability to learn from hindsight is often hampered by patchy long-term observations (Polasky et al., 2011; Carpenter et al., 2015). One way of dealing with these challenges, and offering informed insights into the socio-ecological tradeoffs we may have to navigate in the foreseeable future, is the process of scenario development. Scenarios are plausible stories about how the future may unfold based on known patterns, new or anticipated drivers, or alternative societal choices. Scenarios aren’t predictions, but rather they are alternative futures that explore different trajectories of change and possibilities for adaptation (Raskin 2005; Mahmoud et al., 2009). Scenario analysis connects stakeholder-led storylines about the socio-ecological futures of most interest, with key supporting drivers that can ideally be quantified (e.g. land-use mosaics, climate) and used as inputs for predictive models that can capture the complexity of the human-natural system based on available evidence. This enables simulations about how the system is likely to respond from multiple perspectives and in turn an ability to assess trade-offs, allowing decision-making to be tailored towards desired outcomes. This general process of scenario analysis has been used to guide strategic planning at the catchment scale in various cases around the world, albeit with differing objectives, supporting drivers, assessment methods and assumptions (e.g. Mahmoud et al., 2009; Bryan et al., 2011; Carpenter et al., 2015, Booth et al., 2016). The Peel-Harvey Estuary and its regional community provides a rich opportunity to explore forward-looking scenarios that help distil the core elements of sustainability across this complex system, and guide smarter development choices that support this fast-growing region yet minimise downstream impacts on its largest natural asset. The catchment-estuary system has rich environmental and ecological historical data sets, in some cases dating back to the 1970s, that have been brought together and supplemented with extensive field sampling under the current ARC Linkage Project (e.g. Huang et al., 2019; Hallett et al., 2019; Valesini et al., 2019). Further work within the Linkage on local economic activity and the relative influence of external economic drivers, supplements our socio-economic understanding of the Peel region (Plummer et al., 2019). Importantly, the coupled catchment-estuary model developed under other components of the Linkage (Huang et al., 2019; Hipsey et al., 2019) provides the framework for synthesising the biophysical complexity of the system, and translating scenario storylines (via underpinning drivers) into expected estuary health responses. Aside from the above knowledge and capabilities, a further key part of the opportunity provided by the Peel-Harvey is the interest and investment by a diverse range of stakeholders in the future wellbeing of the region, both from ecological and socio-economic development perspectives. In line with timelines for broader regional land planning and development directions proposed for the Peel by the State and Commonwealth governments to accommodate projected population increases (Strategic Assessment of the Perth and Peel Regions-‘SAPPR’, released in 2015 as the Draft Perth and Peel Green Growth Plan for 3.5 million [Government of Western Australia, 2015] and currently under review), the future horizon we have selected for our socio-ecological scenarios of the Peel-Harvey is 2050. The main objectives of this project component are as follows. 11.3 Objectives Identify which socio-ecological scenarios about the Peel-Harvey in 2050 are of most interest to Peel stakeholders to explore. Translate each of the key scenario narratives into input data and parameters used by the coupled estuary-catchment model. Forecast how key indices reflecting both estuary health and the broader societal health of the Peel region are likely to respond under each 2050 scenario, relative to the present (‘base case’). Summarise the anticipated socio-ecological trade-offs under each 2050 scenario. 11.4 Approach 11.4.1 Identifying key stakeholder values and 2050 scenarios 11.4.1.1 Initial stakeholder workshop A half-day workshop was held in June 2018 and attended by ~25 participants representing different management (State-local), community or scientific agencies with interests in the health of the Peel-Harvey Estuary and/or development of the Peel region. The main aims of the workshop were to understand, looking towards a future horizon of 2050, which (1) values were most important to maintain and (2) plausible scenarios (or ‘stories’) were most important to explore. In providing their answers, stakeholders were asked to consider both the ecosystem health of the Peel-Harvey Estuary, and the socio-economic health of the broader Peel region. An introductory presentation was first provided to outline the scenario concept, beginning with a plausible story or narrative, then how this descriptive information could be translated into underpinning quantitative drivers, which could be applied to biophysical models (being developed under the broader Linkage project; Huang et al., 2019; Hipsey et al., 2019; Kilminster et al., 2019) to predict response of the Peel-Harvey system from various perspectives (and particularly those reflecting stakeholder values). Comparison of system responses of interest would then enable trade-offs between them to be explored. A conceptual summary of this scenario approach is given in Figure 11.1. Workshop participants were then asked to anonymously complete a survey (see Appendix 1), considering what was important to them and their organisation more broadly, after guiding them through its main questions and their objectives. The four main questions in the survey were focused on the following: The most important values to sustain in 2050, from an estuary health perspective and regional social and economic perspectives. The 2050 scenarios that were most important to explore for their possible impacts on estuarine and/or societal health. This question had two parts. Describing plausible ‘what-if’ stories of 2050 scenarios. Identifying specific combinations of catchment land-uses and/or management practices, and their implementation level, of most interest. Ranking aspirational goals for 2050. Specific 2050 estuary condition states (e.g. health status or environmental threshold) of most interest. Figure 11.1: Summary of the main components underlying the scenarios concept that was adopted for exploring socio-ecological trade-offs in the Peel-Harvey system in 2050. 11.4.1.2 Distilling key values and 2050 scenarios Values and Goals (Q1 and 3): Written values, along with their ranks (1, most important, to 5, less important) were transcribed and assigned to broader categories that captured their main intent. The ranks made by each person in each category were averaged, then the number of averaged ranks falling into ‘high’ (ranks 1-2.5), ‘medium’ (ranks 2.6-3.9) and ‘lower’ (ranks 4-5) categories were counted. For the aspirational goals, ranks assigned to each of the 13+ goal statements were collated, then the number of ranks falling into ‘high’ (ranks 1-3), ‘medium’ (ranks 4-7) and ‘lower’ (rank &gt;8) categories were counted. 2050 scenarios (Q2): The 2050 stories (Q2a) described by each participant were interpreted by assigning statements within the narratives to broader description categories, and counting the number of times each person mentioned each category type. These counts were then subjected to various statistical routines in the Primer v7 multivariate statistics software (Clarke and Gorley 2015) to cluster participants’ narratives into significantly different ‘story groups’, and determine which narrative descriptions best characterised each group. For the 2050 land-use/management practice combinations (Q2b), scores representing the implementation levels for each land-use/management practice class (10, high implementation; 5, moderate implementation; 1, low implementation; 0 no implementation) were assigned to each person based on their narratives. Additional classes beyond those stated in Q2b (see Appendix 1) were mentioned by some participants, which were also included in the collated data set and scored as above. These data, with a focus on the ‘high implementation’ level, were subjected to the same statistical routines as that for Q2a, resulting in significantly different clusters of catchment use and management, and an understanding of the particular land-uses and practices that best characterised each. Estuary condition states (Q4): Each narrative was interpreted as described for Q2a, and the counts in each broader category then summed and plotted. 11.4.1.3 Follow-up stakeholder workshop A follow-up stakeholder workshop was held in June 2019 to present the key sets of values and scenarios distilled from the analyses undertaken in section 5.1.2, and outline the approach for interpreting those narratives as quantitative inputs for the coupled estuary-catchment model (section 5.2). Feedback from this workshop was used to refine the model drivers, which are outlined below. 11.4.2 Setting-up model drivers – defining future conditions The coupled estuary-catchment model requires specific datasets (termed ‘drivers’) to undertake the 2050 scenario modelling. Three groups of drivers used by the catchment model were presented to the stakeholders to help guide scenario configuration. Climate: Current climate (derived from the 2006-2015 period) or a projected 2050 dry climate, which included anomalies for rainfall and potential evapotranspiration. Land-use: Land-use affects the amount of surface runoff and nutrients that are exported from the catchment to the estuary model. The following urban, agricultural and natural land-use classes were provided as options: Urban Beef grazing Cropping Dairy Horses and lifestyle blocks Horticulture Industry, manufacturing and transport Intensive animal use Plantation Native vegetation Management practices: Particular management actions applied to relevant land-uses can reduce nutrient export to the estuary model. The following 11 actions could be applied within the Peel-Harvey catchment, and were provided as options: Soil amendments Improved fertiliser management Improved fertiliser management and low water soluble phosphorus fertiliser use Riparian zone rehabilitation Dairy effluent management Waste water treatment plant (WWTP) effluent management Point source management Water sensitive urban design (WSUD) in existing urban areas Septic tank removal Catchment revegetation Constructed wetlands In addition to the above drivers which were explored through the scenario selection, additional changes also need to be considered for the oceanic forcing of the system. Sea level rise is estimated to continue towards the end of 21st century (IPCC, 2007; Kuhn et al., 2011), and by 2050 it is assumed 30 cm additional see level rise relative to the 2016 condition (see also Huang et al., 2019). Alternate input files representing the 2050 sea level and temperature were therefore prepared accordingly. 11.4.3 Assessing futute estuarine health under 2050 scenarios The outcomes of the values assessment and scenario definition were used to generate plausible future inputs for climate, ocean and catchment conditions and management practices. These were used to run a coupled catchment-estuary water quality simulation for each scenario, spanning one hydrologic-year (April-April). Each scenario was assessed against a range of practical ecosystem service indicator metrics spanning water quality, biogeochemical function and habitat condition. The Ecosystem Indicators were chosen to align with values and attributes of the system highlighted through stakeholder consultation. Water Quality Indicators - a range of metrics were considered, including: retention time, \\(\\tau\\) salinity, \\(S\\) bottom oxygen, \\(DO_{bot}\\) total nitrogen, \\(TN\\) total phosphorous, \\(TP\\), and chlorophyll-a, \\(TCHLA\\) Ecosystem Indicators - a range of metrics were considered, including: Net nutrient export/assimilation, \\(NEA\\) Composite index of water quality, \\(IWQ\\) Hypoxia likelihood, \\(HYP\\) Water clarity, \\(TUR\\) Harmful Algal Bloom index, \\(HAB\\) Crab Habitat Index, \\(CHI\\) Fish Community Index, \\(FCI\\) For each of these variables we compared: changes in seasonal average conditions between scenarios, in order to explore spatial patterns in water quality attributes; relative change (delta) for a given variable between two scenarios, presented as a map to highlight hotspot areas of change. regional-scale or estuary-scale changes, in order to summarise and compare average conditions For detail on the computational methodology for these attributes, refer to Appendix 2. 11.4.4 Assessing future economic health under 2050 scenarios The framework for assessing economic health indicators is based on the econometrics model used to assess the historical regional job growth data (Plummer et al., 2019). The model has identified core attributes that can be used the comparative and competitive advantage of the regional economy (Table 1). The logic is that enhancing competitive and/or comparative advantage enhances economic performance (through job creation) and, hence, quality of life and standard of living. In turn, the overall competitive and comparative advantage of Peel-Harvey depends of the pattern of industrial structure, which has been previously classified into the key and strategic industries. For example, if Peel Harvey has a relative specialisation in fishing (which is part of the agriculture ANZIC industrial classification), and is assessed as being a rapidly growing industry, then it represents an important industry in terms of job creation and export growth and, hence, an important contributor to the quality of life. In terms of economic “health”, we might think of this in terms of the impact on economic performance of changes in industrial structure, both in terms of the importance of that industry (number of jobs) and in terms of increasing/decreasing overall economic diversity. The assumption in this case is that more diverse economies are more resilient to future shocks and changes. Scenarios are assessed from the point of view of how they are likely to impact each of these indicators. 11.5 Main Findings 11.5.1 Key stakeholder values and 2050 scenarios Stakeholders most value an ecologically healthy estuary with good water quality, as well as environmentally-focused communities, high regional employment and strong growth industries A synthesis of the main stakeholder values and aspirational goals, incorporating perspectives across estuary and socio-economic health, is shown in Fig. 2, with a higher level summary in Table 1. Clearly, the most important value, which was also reinforced by the 2050 goals, was high estuarine biodiversity and accompanying health (Fig. 2a, b). Participants gave various responses that fell into this category, such as ‘good to excellent ecological health’; ‘biodiverse and/or resilient waterways’; ‘healthy wildlife’ (including fish, birds and/or dolphins); ‘healthy seagrass habitats’; ‘no/less major fish kills’ and ‘retaining Ramsar status’. Good water quality, underpinned by value and/or goal statements such as ‘no harmful algal blooms’, ‘TN/TP half of current levels’, ‘good dissolved oxygen levels’ ‘reduced contaminants’ was also ranked highly (Fig. 2a, b). Socially, a Peel community that was environmentally-focused (e.g. ‘behaviour change towards environmentally sustainable practices’; ‘better community engagement/education in improving estuarine health’; ‘waterwise community’) and had good amenity to the estuary (e.g. ‘the estuary looks nice’; ‘good waterway recreation’; ‘good wildlife watching’) was highly valued (Fig. 2a), with supporting highly-ranked goal statements (e.g. ‘mandatory water sensitive urban design’; ‘mandatory nutrient testing programs’; Fig. 2b). From an economic perspective, better employment opportunities (e.g. ‘higher and/or more diverse employment’; ‘increased work skills’; ‘increased youth employment’) and sustaining key industries (e.g. ‘high growth/export industries’; ‘strong fishing/eco-tourism industries’) were clearly important (Fig. 2a). Table 1 further collates the key values and goals by combining several under umbrella statements that are likely to lead to a similar outcome. For example, if an ecologically-healthy estuary is attained (with accompanying ecological attributes like ‘high biodiversity’), it is envisaged that desired social outcomes such as ‘good wildlife watching’ will also be met, and probably that social actions such as ‘increased community engagement in estuarine health’ helped reach that status. Additionally, if estuarine water quality is good, social amenity (e.g. ‘estuary looks nice’, ‘good waterway recreation’) is probably also high. Key indices developed under the broader Linkage Project (see Appendix 2), were assigned as proxies for evaluating the extent to which the key values/goals are met, and are also included in Table 2. Stakeholders most want to explore three 2050 scenarios, reflecting either (i) good estuarine health, environmental stewardship and eco-tourism, (ii) a ‘business as usual’ approach or (iii) poor estuarine health outcomes, extensive urban development and amplified climate change Three main story groups were identified when participants’ narratives were analysed to determine where the most natural yet significantly-different ‘breaks’ lay within the story compositions (CLUSTER and accompanying SIMPROF test, P &lt;0.05). The ‘tree diagram’ in Fig. 3a presents these findings, illustrating how the various stories were split into successively smaller groups based on similarities in their compositions, with those splitting away at the top of the tree being the most different. Additionally, groups of stories marked by red lines indicate those containing no significant differences, meaning that finer splits into smaller groups at lower levels of the tree are essentially redundant. While five story groups were identified, two (‘a’ and ‘c’) contained only one story and were considered anomalies. Further analyses to explore which particular combinations of narrative categories best characterised each story group are shown in Fig. 3b; simply, the darker the shading in this plot, the more frequently that narrative category was mentioned. There were clear differences in narrative among the three main groups. Story group ‘b’ obviously typified an environmentally-optimistic Peel in 2050, underpinned by a strong focus by government, industry and community on improving estuarine health, leading to decreased nutrient flows to the estuary, ecologically-healthy and biodiverse waterways, high waterway amenity and a strong eco-tourism industry. Story group ‘d’, however, which was coined ‘business as usual’, mainly focused on understanding how the Peel socio-ecological system would look in 2050 under the level of population growth and catchment development footprint proposed in the Strategic Assessment of the Perth and Peel Regions (SAPPR). This State-Commonwealth initiative, which is currently under review, was released in 2015 as the Draft Perth and Peel Green Growth Plan for 3.5 million (Government of Western Australia, 2015) and aims to set the regional land planning and development directions to accommodate a projected 70% population increase by 2050. This story group also favoured no new implementation of management practices, and am ambivalent approach by government and industry towards estuarine health. The final story group (e) was mainly characterised by an environmentally-pessimistic outlook on the Peel in 2050, with common narratives around poor estuarine water quality, ecological health, fishing, waterway amenity and environmental stewardship across all sectors of society. Population growth and urban expansion was also higher than anticipated under the SAPPR, accompanied by an increase in agricultural development, and climate change effects were amplified. With regards to the two outlier stories ‘a’ and ‘c’, the first was characterised by a collapse of the beef and dairy industries, leading to a major population decline and ultimately a re-colonisation of agricultural land by natural vegetation, while the second was an extreme scenario of water scarcity across the region (Fig. 3b). The specific catchment land-uses and/or management practices of most interest to the stakeholders (i.e. survey question 2b; Appendix 1) were also subjected to similar analyses to distil those catchment drivers that best underpinned the above story groups and could be readily parameterised in the catchment model. Four main groups were identified, along with three outliers represented by single responses that were not explored further (Fig. 4a). Of the four main groups, ‘a’ was focused on urban development (and specifically that proposed under the SAPPR development footprint) along with accompanying water sensitive urban design (WSUD), group ‘b’ focused on fertiliser and effluent (waste water, dairy management, irrigation and point source) management, group ‘c’ prioritised soil amendments and fertiliser management, and group ‘d’ centered on riparian zone rehabilitation (Fig. 4b). The outcomes of survey question 4, which was intended to uncover specific 2050 estuary condition states of most interest to the stakeholders, largely supported the findings from survey question 2. About 48% of the responses related to the ecological health of the estuary, with most concentrating on ‘good to excellent’ health and wanting to understand which catchment development and/or management practices would best support this (i.e. similar to the environmentally-optimistic story group above). A further 27% of responses related to estuarine water quality, with most wanting to explore estuary salinisation under anticipated or amplified climate change conditions, and the risk of harmful algal blooms (comparable to narratives within the environmentally-pessimistic story group). The remaining responses related to exploring the impacts on estuary condition of increasing riparian vegetation, maintaining a ‘business as usual’ approach to management, or increased bank erosion, most of which were covered under the story or catchment management groups identified in the analyses for survey question 2. Table 3 summarises the main 2050 scenarios distilled from the above consultation and data analysis process, capturing the three main story groups, their broad underpinning catchment and climate drivers, and the anticipated responses of the socio-ecological health indices chosen to reflect the key stakeholder values and goals (Table 2). 11.5.2 Model drivers for each scenario The calibrated catchment model was used to explore each of the above three scenarios under two different climate conditions. It was also used to characterise the current or ‘base case’ catchment land-use and management level to provide a benchmark for comparison. This resulted in eight separate scenarios, which are summarised in Table 3. Full details regarding the base case model pararametisation (0a and 0b) are provided in Hennig et al. (in prep.). The base case took existing land-use (agriculture 5,140 ha, urban 240 ha, natural vegetation 4,000 ha), and applied two climate regimes – expected current climate (pre-2018) and forecast 2050 dry climate. For the environmentally-optimistic scenario (1a and 1b), we assumed high phosphorus retentive fill would be used in all new urban developments. The urban footprint used was based on the planned urban development footprint (Fig. 5) provided in the Draft Green Growth Plan. The ‘extensive catchment management’ applied in this scenario included: Soil amendments – 100% of low phosphorus retentive index (PRI) soils. Riparian zone rehabilitation - 337 km of fencing and revegetation (100% of riparian zones on the Swan Coastal Plain for maximum nitrogen removal). Fertiliser management with low water soluble phosphorus fertilisers – 100% of beef and dairy farms. WWTP effluent management – Waroona WWTP only. Point source management – 100% of point sources (intensive agricultural land-uses). Dairy effluent management - 25 farms (100%). WSUD in existing urban areas – 100% of existing urban. For the business as usual scenario (2a and 2b), planned urban development (as per the environmentally-optimistic scenario) in addition to the planned Peel Food Zone was included in the land-use change inputs of the model. The Peel Food Zone was included as 3,000 hectares of in-ground horticulture in the Nambeelup catchment, which resulted in a land-use change of beef farming to horticulture. No management actions were implemented in the model under this scenario. For the environmentally-pessimistic scenario (3a and 3b), planned urban development plus 5,625 hectares of additional urban development (Fig. 5) were modelled to represent urban growth in excess of that forecast in the Draft Green Growth Plan. We represented additional agricultural growth by doubling the area of annual horticulture (an additional 3,000 ha to the Peel Food Zone) which was placed in the north Dandalup catchment. 11.5.3 Catchment model scenario outputs The average annual catchment discharge of flow and nutrients to the Peel-Harvey Estuary for each of the eight scenarios modelled are summarised in Table 4 and Fig. 6. The fate and impact of catchment runoff and nutrient loading is outlined in Hipsey et al. (2019) and discussed in section 5.4 below. Comparison between the current and future climate scenarios showed that the 2050 dry climate reduced flow and nutrient loads to the estuary by approximately 50%. However, flow-weighted concentrations of nutrients (average annual nutrient load divided by average annual flow) were reduced by a much smaller amount, i.e. 7% for nitrogen and 9% for phosphorus. Flow-weighted nutrient concentrations are less sensitive to changes in hydrology and climate, and have been used to compare scenarios in this section of the report. In terms of these concentrations, there was little difference between the current and future climate for each of the scenarios, but differences were evident between scenarios. Urban development increased surface water runoff by approximately 5–10%, but had a negligible effect on nutrient runoff in all scenarios. Agricultural development resulted in an increase in nutrient runoff in scenarios 2 (business as usual) and 3 (environmentally-pessimistic) relative to the base-case. Flow-weighted nutrient concentrations were increased by approximately 13% (N) and 34% (P) in scenario 2, and were increased by 19% (N) and 43% (P) in scenario 3. The environmentally-optimistic scenario resulted in a 24% reduction in flow-weighted nitrogen concentrations and a 69% reduction in flow-weighted phosphorus concentrations. Note that the management actions that were modelled in this scenario were targeted towards phosphorus. Approximately 58% of the phosphorus reduction was achieved from improved fertiliser management and soil amendments. 11.5.4 Estuary health trajectories The water and nutrient outputs from the catchment modelling created a characteristic set of estuary water quality and ecosystem indicators for each scenario. These are compared side-by-side in Figures 7-16 by looking at scenario predictions relative to the base-case (0a). The various indicators show a complex pattern of change due to: a) the changing climate (“a” vs “b”), and b) the changing land-use/land management scenarios (“0”, “1”, “2” and “3”). In general, the largest wholesale difference in water quality attributes and ecological indicators occurred between the “a” and “b” scenarios, highlighting the significance of sea-level rise and reduced catchment inflow volume on the overall pattern of water quality. The relatively low flow entering in the “1”, “2” and “3” scenario set meant that water quality was relatively insensitive to these at the estuary-scale. It must however be considered though that this is comparing a single flow regime and not fully assessing the range of future variability that could be expected. Further, the water quality response between the scenarios is evident in some regions more than others, particular in the rivers, as the increasing marinisation of the system is expected to take hold. For example, DO in shallow areas of the main lagoons is predicted to improve, whilst the rivers show a considerable decline, particularly the Murray River which is on average expected to be &gt;2 mg/L lower than present. Nutrients were also varied across the domain, with slight reductions in some regions of the lagoons, but increases in the rivers that varied in accordance with the nutrient loading scenario (Figure 11). The variation of the key water quality attributes and ecological habitats in the scenarios are further summarized in Figure 17-20, in comparison with the outputs in the historical years, by reducing the indicators to a single annual value. The rivers (Figure 17-18) show higher salinity, water age and phytoplankton biomass, and lower DO in the “b” scenarios while the changes between the land management scenarios are relatively smaller. In comparison to the historical years, the “b” scenarios with dry climate is shown to have lower the IWQ, turbidity, and increased ecological habitat areas for crab and phytoplankton in the Serpentine River. Whilst in the “a” scenarios, these attributes are in comparable ranges with the historical years. The land management is shown to have a strong impact on the nutrient levels of the Serpentine River, where the mean TN and TP concentration are much higher in the “2” and “3” scenarios (with relatively higher concentration nutrient loading from catchment) than the “0” and “1” scenarios. The future scenarios favor the growth condition for cyanobacteria, and the “2” and “3” scenarios favor the growth condition for dinoflagellate. Whilst in the Murray River, the “a” scenarios show more variation in the nutrient levels, although the nutrient concentrations in the “b” scenarios are relatively higher than the “a” scenarios. The habitat area stays stable for cyanobacteria, but improves for dinoflagellate. The habitat area for juvenile in the “b” scenarios are relatively lower to the “a” scenarios, but for adult crab are higher. The lagoons illustrate different behaviour to the rivers in the scenarios (Figure 19-20). Although the IWQ still decreases in the scenarios when compared to historical years, the habitat area for cyanobacteria has dropped to nearly zero, while the habitat area for dinoflagellate stays relatively stable. The dry climate in the “b” scenarios is shown to lower the juvenile and dinoflagellate habitat areas but increase the adult crab habitat area. The “b” scenario has more impacts on the Harvey Lagoon than the Peel Inlet in terms of crab and dinoflagellate habitat areas. Whilst in the Peel Inlet, the differences of the habitat areas between the “a” and “b” scenarios are relatively smaller, indicating the Peel Inlet is relatively insensitive to the climate change. The mean DO in the lagoons has improved although the nutrient levels are still high in the scenarios. The total amount of nutrient loading and export in the scenarios are relatively small compared to the historical years, yet the ratios of nutrient retention to the catchment loading show similar trends to the historical years in the post-Cut period (Figure 21-22). The “b” scenarios have less nutrient loading when compared to the “a” scenarios and the historical years due to the drier climate. The estuary is shown to net export the nutrients in these scenarios when the ocean flushing exceeds the catchment inputs. 11.5.5 Economic resilience The dynamics and drivers of local competitiveness and comparative advantage shape a regional economy’s responsiveness to externalities (i.e. resilience), and can help explain the underlying forces leading to ‘catch-up’, ‘falling behind’ and ‘forging ahead’ trajectories (Plummer et al. 2019). The three main scenarios reported in the previous sections (1,2,3) have been considered through this lens, and according to the analysis framework previously reported. An example of the assessment of economic indicators for each scenario is described in Tables 5–7. 11.6 Balancing Trade-offs Between Economic and Environmental Health To ultimately facilitate decision-making a holistic view of scenarios is required that can link the environmental health and economic health indicators in a linear decision support logic (Figure 23). Rather than adopting detailed analysis of specific economic activities, profitability and ecosystem service monetization, we instead consider the system from a resilience point of view, and in our assessment seek to answer the following questions: Does the option promote job creation (e.g., by focusing export-oriented growth industries)? Is the option diversifying the economy (e.g., promoting macro-economic resilience)? Does the option lead to environmental decline, and is the decline likely to impact economic activity, or community sensitivity towards industry? Is the option likely to induce negative feedbacks between economy and environment (e.g., strong coupling can accelerating links, likely leading to degradation)? How sensitive is the option relative to exogenous drivers (climate change or external economic shocks)? For this purpose, we begin by adopting a modified Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) coastal management framework as the basis for linking drivers, actions and responses to the state of system (Elliott et al. 2017). Specifically, the more comprehensive DAPSI(W)R(M) framework (hereafter DAPSIWRM) was employed and configured for the Peel-Harvey catchment-estuary system to structure the effects of changes to the natural system on the varied human uses and benefits of the marine system, and vice-versa. The utility of this approach is its ability to combine various exogenous (external) and endogenous (internal) drivers across multiple scales, in a way that clearly depicts the feedbacks and inter-relationships that develop in a what is a complex Socio-Ecological-System (SES), structured using an established logic. For the Peel-Harvey catchment-estuary system feedbacks and linkages occur between environmental quality and economy, though highlighting that not all economic growth in the region is directly connected to the environment directly (Figure 24). Whilst the SES feedback diagram depicted above is useful for contextualizing the varied pressures, actions, impacts and responses that are occurring in the coupled system, it remains difficult to develop a dynamic model connecting environment and economy in a way that is quantitative and can easily support decision making. In particular, large ambiguity in specifying response functions linking environmental and socio-economic system elements and inadequate socio-economic data to fully parameterise such a model would lead to predictions that are too uncertain for long-term prediction, which is a known challenge of dynamic socio-ecologic models (Elshaefi et al., 2015). Therefore, to operationalise the framework as a decision support tool we introduce a modified Bow-Tie method (Cormier et al., 2019). The core structure of the framework is presented generically below in Figure 25. Traditionally, the Bow-Tie method is used for risk analysis to understand how changes or actions that may create risk could be isolated, controlled and eliminated. This logic makes sense in the context of coastal management as we ultimately seek to eliminate risks to the environment (e.g. poor water quality) or risks to the community (e.g., industry decline and job loss). The approach presented in Cormier et al. (2019) is an interesting option as takes an ISO-compliant risk management framework to coastal ecosystem decline, and at its core is therefore designed from the point of view of supporting managers to make the right decision to reduce risk to an asset in the face of “escalating” factors – in our case the drivers changing the system. This method is however relatively new in this context and there are limited examples how this can integrate risks to the environment and economy in a tractable way. Further, it has been identified that rather than aiming for sustainable management to reduce risk, we could consider from the counter point of view, which is to maximise opportunity (e.g. for economic growth). In essence, at the core of our decision making to balance trade-offs, is a desire to a) reduce risk to vulnerable assets (e.g., the environment) and enhance opportunity to improve regional competitiveness (e.g., through job growth). Therefore, in our context, we have developed a revised Bow-Tie decision support framework that is able to highlight how escalating factors (drivers and actions) are either reducing our ability to realise an opportunity, or creating vulnerability in a valued asset, and therefore need to be managed. Management of the system (right-side of the Bow-Tie) is supported through undertaking adaptive measures and tracking progress against environmental and economic indicators that are known to adequately describe system function from the decision-makers point of view (Figure 25). The structure presented above is generic, but can be tailored to specific “assets” and/or specific escalating factors (e.g., how is climate change escalating risks associated with hypoxia?). This way a standard logic can be used to assess the varied stressors on the system. However, inherently the Peel-Harvey catchment-estuary system is inherently complex facing multiple stressors, all impacting on a wide array of system attributes of relevance to management. We therefore applied the general framework in Figure 25 to align it with the varied issues and indicators raised by the project team and stakeholders in Table 2 (Figure 26). The diagram exemplifies how the wide range of policies, plans and actions being undertaken by local agencies can be structured in a standard way. This can ensure consistency between management plans identified at the project or organisation level, whilst encouraging a common approach to risk and opportunity identification, and how they are monitored, evaluated and reported. We also highlight that, whilst we have aimed to be as comprehensive in coverage of this framework as possible, the framework presented here may require further refinement and inclusion as it becomes operationalised. A process of auditing relevant LGA policies and management plans relevant to Peel-Harvey catchment-estuary system is therefore recommended to allow for continual revision of framework. As a demonstration of the decision-support framework for the specific scenarios identified during our stakeholder consultation process, and the subsequent analysis in Section 5.1, we visually depict the scenarios 1, 2 and 3 in Figures 27-29, by linking the identified drivers and management measures with the reported environmental and economic indicators. The results demonstrate that the environmentally-optimistic scenario can provide the best option for growth through encouraging diversification in export oriented industries and improving the specialisation of agriculture. 11.7 Conclusions The challenge for decision-making is understanding how drivers and pressures acting over diverse scales will impact on environmental and economic health. This chapter outlines a framework this assessment, specific for the Peel-Harvey catchment-estuary system. Based on a synthesis of stakeholder values, the catchment model was used to compare three catchment management scenarios (environmentally-optimistic, business as usual, and environmentally pessimistic/economically optimistic), under two climate regimes (current and 2050 dry). Climate had an overwhelming influence on reducing flows to the estuary (approximately 50%) and this resulted in a similar reduction in the load of nitrogen and phosphorus in the future climate (2050 dry) compared to the current scenarios. Since nutrient loads and flow were reduced by the same proportions, this means that the average concentrations of nutrients in the water (i.e. flow weighted concentrations) were not affected by the influence of future climate projections. There were significant differences between the catchment management scenarios, with the environmentally-optimistic scenario demonstrating significant improvements with 24% reduction in flow-weighted nitrogen concentrations and a 69% reduction in flow-weighted phosphorus concentrations. Linking these results to the estuary response model was undertaken for each scenario. Comparing the scenarios allowed us to disentangle the future changes brought about by climate change (sea level rise, reduced flows) and catchment changes. The projected changes due to climate change were notable, and, due to the decreasing catchment loads, the relative difference between catchment management alternatives were not as striking as originally hypothesised when the scenarios were designed. To enable a holistic comparison, we then created a DSS by linking the DAPSIWRM system framework with environmental and economic indicators. For this purpose a ISO compliant risk analysis framework was adapted to help logically structure the various activities to enable a transparent process for assessing the trade-offs between scenarios. Assessment of the scenarios using this framework has clearly highlighted that the time for adaptation is now. Some environmental indicators show benefits, but generally the future poses risks that require adaptive management. Decline in catchment flows will manifestly change the nature of our rivers and concentrate poor water quality. Estuary water requirements need to be defined and employed as soon as possible to prevent further decline of the rivers in low flow years. Notably, catchment management will help adaptation to the drying trend. Changes in hydrology mean that traditional nutrient targets could be revised. Environmentally-sensitive land management and development priorities can encourage long-term economic resilience, but needs to be balanced with export-oriented activity to retain competitiveness such as technological innovation in agriculture, mining opportunities and tourism growth. Adaptive measures to enhance regional investment in growing and under-developed industries could be identified to encourage diversification. The drying climate may provide the Peel region a comparative advantage, encouraging tourism and attracting skilled labour, however, this opportunity is also a vulnerability. 11.8 Acknowledgements We would to thank all of our ARC Linkage Project Partners and wider Peel stakeholders who participated in our scenarios workshop, and shared their thoughts and visions for the Peel region in 2050.
