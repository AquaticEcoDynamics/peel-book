Macroalgae provides abundant food shelter several fish species, well known weed-associated, e.g. Estuary cobbler Western striped grunter.

Hallett Hall (2012) experimentally tested efficiency large (102 m) small (21 m) seine nets used last 40 years Peel-Harvey caught different guilds fish. found, example, larger net typically catches fewer smaller species especially rivers (steeper banks reduce fishing efficiency), yet often returns species per haul given potentially broader habitats can reach. Differences gill nets used sample deeper waters 1970s/80s compared recent periods may also impacted comparability fish data sets. example, gill nets used earlier period combination floating sunken nets, recent sampling periods sunken nets may sampled pelagic species less effectively. Additionally, whereas nets set three hours 1970s–1980s, set one hour recent period given revised regulatory requirements ethical considerations. standardised data sets numbers fish caught per hour, nets left water longer periods simply greater likelihood catching greater number species present.Although data standardization methods can adjust effects net biases abundances fish species caught, impossible adjust abundance species never caught given fish sample. , way knowing whether failure net catch species due net type, species simply present. Moving forward, thus strongly recommended avoid sampling biases, standardised fish sampling approach used monitoring ecological condition estuary future (see section 9.4.4). consistent fish sampling regime support FCI monitoring undertaken annually Swan-Canning Estuary since 2012, continues supported Department Biodiversity, Conservation Attractions system (Hallett et al., 2019a). similar approach also adopted Walpole-Nornalup Estuary Department Primary Industries Regional Development (‘Fisheries’) since 2017 (Yeoh et al., 2019).","code":""},{"path":"fish.html","id":"current-ecological-condition-of-the-peel-harvey-estuary-2016-18","chapter":"9 Assessing the Health of the Peel-Harvey Estuary Through its Fish Communities","heading":"9.4.2 Current ecological condition of the Peel-Harvey Estuary (2016-18)","text":"current overall health Peel-Harvey Estuary fair poorMore detailed analysis FCI region sampling season autumn 2016 summer 2018 showed , average, overall health estuary shallow deeper waters fair poor (C–D; see grades larger circles Figs 9.8 9.9).
