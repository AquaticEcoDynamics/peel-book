One metric show improvements earliest latest sampling period proportion fish feeding detritus, mainly reflected lower catches Sea mullet Mugil cephalus 2016-18 (Fig. 7, Appendix 5). reasons decline health basins unclear, though may partly reflect substantial decline green macroalgae 1970s 2018, especially Peel Inlet (see F.

Additionally, given many fish species abundant earlier period feed bottom-dwelling invertebrates, decline time may also reflect poor health invertebrate fauna deeper basin sediments recorded parts Linkage study (see Cronin-O’Reilly, Valesini, Hallett 2019). available data full invertebrate community deeper basins 1970s/80s, evidence shallows shows obvious decline fauna mid-1980s mid-2000s (M.

Lastly, fishing pressure impacts key fishery species Estuary Cobbler, Mulloway Yellow-finned whiting discounted.Nonetheless, notable health deeper waters rivers generally poorer basins last 40 years. mirrors situation Swan-Canning Estuary (C.

Chris S. Hallett Hall (2012) experimentally tested efficiency large (102 m) small (21 m) seine nets used last 40 years Peel-Harvey caught different guilds fish. found, example, larger net typically catches fewer smaller species especially rivers (steeper banks reduce fishing efficiency), yet often returns species per haul given potentially broader habitats can reach. Differences gill nets used sample deeper waters 1970s/80s compared recent periods may also impacted comparability fish data sets. example, gill nets used earlier period combination floating sunken nets, recent sampling periods sunken nets may sampled pelagic species less effectively. Additionally, whereas nets set three hours 1970s–1980s, set one hour recent period given revised regulatory requirements ethical considerations. standardised data sets numbers fish caught per hour, nets left water longer periods simply greater likelihood catching greater number species present.Although data standardization methods can adjust effects net biases abundances fish species caught, impossible adjust abundance species never caught given fish sample. , way knowing whether failure net catch species due net type, species simply present. Moving forward, thus strongly recommended avoid sampling biases, standardised fish sampling approach used monitoring ecological condition estuary future (see section 5.4). consistent fish sampling regime support FCI monitoring undertaken annually Swan-Canning Estuary since 2012, continues supported Department Biodiversity, Conservation Attractions system (Chris S.
